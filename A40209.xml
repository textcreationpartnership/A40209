            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE TESTIMONY OF Margaret Fox Concerning her Late Husband GEORGE FOX;</head>
            <head type="sub">TOGETHER With a brief Account of ſome of his <hi>Travels, Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings</hi> and <hi>Hardſhips</hi> endured for the <hi>Truth's</hi> ſake.</head>
            <p>IT having pleaſed Almighty God to take away my <hi>Dear Husband</hi> out of this <hi>Evil, Troubleſome World,</hi> who <hi>was not a Man thereof;</hi> being Choſen out of it, and had his <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Being</hi> in <hi>another Region,</hi> and his Teſtimony was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>World,</hi> that the <hi>Deeds</hi> thereof were <hi>evil,</hi> and therefore the <hi>World hated</hi> him: So I am now to give in my Account and <hi>Teſtimony</hi> for my <hi>Dear Husband,</hi> whom the <hi>Lord</hi> hath taken unto his bleſſed <hi>Kingdom</hi> and <hi>Glory.</hi> And it is before me from the <hi>Lord,</hi> and in my View, to give a <hi>Relation,</hi> and leave upon Record the <hi>Dealings</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> with us from the Beginning.</p>
            <p>He was the <hi>Inſtrument</hi> in the <hi>Hand</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Age,</hi> which he made uſe of to ſend forth into the <hi>World,</hi> to preach the <hi>Everlaſting Goſpel,</hi> which had been hid from many <hi>Ages</hi> and <hi>Generations;</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> Revealed it unto him, and made him <hi>open</hi> that <hi>New</hi> and <hi>Living Way,</hi> that Leads to <hi>Life Eternal,</hi> when he was but a <hi>Youth,</hi> and a <hi>Stripling.</hi> And when he De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared it in his own Country of <hi>Leiceſterſhire,</hi> and in <hi>Darbyſhire, Nottinghamſhire</hi> and <hi>Warwickſhire,</hi> and his Declaration being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Hireling-Prieſts</hi> and their Practices, it raiſed a Great Fury and Oppoſition amongſt the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>People</hi> againſt him: yet there was always <hi>ſome,</hi> that owned him in ſeveral places; but very few, that ſtood firm to him, when <hi>Perſecution</hi> came on him. There was <hi>he</hi> and <hi>one other</hi> put in <hi>Priſon</hi> at <hi>Darby,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His <hi>first</hi> Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> but the other <hi>declined,</hi> and left him in <hi>Priſon</hi> there; where he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued almoſt a <hi>whole Year,</hi> and then he was <hi>Releaſed</hi> out of <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:</hi> And went on with his <hi>Teſtimony</hi> abroad,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Second</hi> Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> and was put in <hi>Priſon</hi> again at <hi>Nottingham;</hi> and there he continued a while, and after was <hi>Releaſed</hi> again.</p>
            <pb n="ii" facs="tcp:51448:3"/>
            <p>And then he Travelled on into <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> and paſſed up and down that Great <hi>County,</hi> and ſeveral received him; as <hi>William Dewsbury, Richard Farnſworth, Thomas Aldam</hi> and others, who all came to be faithful <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> for the <hi>Lord.</hi> And he continued in that Country, and Travelled thorow <hi>Holderneſs</hi> and the <hi>Wowlds,</hi> and abundance were <hi>Convinced;</hi> and ſeveral were brought to <hi>Priſon</hi> at <hi>York</hi> for their <hi>Testimony</hi> to the <hi>Truth,</hi> both <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Women:</hi> So that we heard of <hi>ſuch</hi> a <hi>People</hi> that were <hi>Riſen,</hi> and we did very much <hi>inquire</hi> after them. And after a while he Travelled up farther towards the <hi>Dales</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> as <hi>Wenſdale,</hi> and <hi>Sedbur;</hi> and amongſt the <hi>Hills, Dales</hi> and <hi>Mountains</hi> he came on, and <hi>Convinced</hi> many of the Eternal <hi>Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the Year 1652. it pleaſed the <hi>Lord</hi> to draw him to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us; ſo he came on from <hi>Sedbur,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Weſtmorland,</hi> as <hi>Firbank-Chappel,</hi> where <hi>John Blaykling</hi> came with him: and ſo on to <hi>Preſton,</hi> and to <hi>Grarig,</hi> and <hi>Kendal,</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder-barrow,</hi> and <hi>Poobank,</hi> and <hi>Cartmel,</hi> and <hi>Staveley;</hi> and ſo on to <hi>Swarth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi> my Dwelling-Houſe, whither he brought the bleſſed Tide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Everlaſting <hi>Goſpel,</hi> which I, and many <hi>Hundreds</hi> in theſe parts, have cauſe to praiſe the <hi>Lord</hi> for. My then Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, <hi>Thomas Fell,</hi> was not at home at that time, but gone the <hi>Welch Circuit,</hi> being one of the <hi>Judges</hi> of <hi>Aſſize:</hi> And our Houſe being a Place open to entertain <hi>Miniſters</hi> and Religious People at, one of <hi>George Fox</hi> his Friends brought him hither; where he ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all Night. And the next day, being a <hi>Lecture,</hi> or a <hi>Faſt-day,</hi> he went to <hi>Ulverſton-Steeple-houſe,</hi> but came not in, till <hi>People</hi> were <hi>gathered;</hi> I and my <hi>Children</hi> had been a long time there before. And when they were <hi>ſinging</hi> before the <hi>Sermon,</hi> he came in; and when they had done <hi>ſinging,</hi> he ſtood up upon a Seat or Form, and deſired, <hi>That he might have liberty to ſpeak:</hi> And he that was in the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> ſaid <hi>he might.</hi> And the firſt words, that he ſpoke, were as followeth: <hi>He is not a</hi> Jew, <hi>that is one outward; neither is that</hi> Circumciſion, <hi>which is outward: But he is a</hi> Jew, <hi>that is one inward; and that is</hi> Circumciſion, <hi>which is of the heart.</hi> And ſo he went on, and ſaid, How <hi>that Chriſt was the</hi> Light <hi>of the</hi> World, <hi>and ligheth every Man that cometh into the World; and that by this</hi> Light <hi>they might be gathered to God,</hi> &amp;c. And I ſtood up in my <hi>Pew,</hi> and I wondered at his <hi>Doctrine;</hi> for I had never heard ſuch before. And then he went on, and opened the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and ſaid; <hi>The Scriptures were the</hi> Prophets <hi>words, and</hi> Chriſt<hi>'s and the</hi> Apoſtle<hi>'s words, and what, as they ſpoke, they enjoyed and poſſeſſed, and had it from the Lord:</hi> And ſaid, <hi>Then what had any to do with the</hi> Scriptures, <hi>but as they came to the</hi> Spirit, <hi>that gave them forth. You will ſay,</hi> Chriſt <hi>ſaith this, and the</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles <hi>ſay this; but what canſt thou ſay? Art thou a Child of</hi> Light, <hi>and haſt walked in the</hi> Light, <hi>and what thou ſpeakeſt, is it inwardly from God?</hi> &amp;c. This opened me ſo, that it <hi>cut</hi> me to the <hi>Heart;</hi> and then I ſaw clearly, we were all wrong. So I ſat me down in my <hi>Pew</hi> again, and <hi>cried bitterly:</hi> And I cried in my <hi>Spirit</hi> to the <hi>Lord, We are all Thieves, we are all Thieves; we have taken the</hi>
               <pb n="iii" facs="tcp:51448:3"/> Scriptures <hi>in</hi> Words, <hi>and know nothing of them in our ſelves.</hi> So that ſerved me, that I cannot well tell, what he ſpake after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; but he went on in declaring againſt the <hi>falſe Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and <hi>Deceivers</hi> of the <hi>People.</hi> And there was one <hi>John Sawrey,</hi> a <hi>Juſtice</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> and a <hi>Profeſſor,</hi> that bid the Churchwarden, <hi>Take him away:</hi> And he laid his hands on him ſeveral times, and took them off again, and let him alone; and then after a while he gave over, and came to our Houſe again that night. And he ſpoke in the <hi>Family</hi> amongſt the <hi>Servants,</hi> and they were all generally <hi>Convinced;</hi> as <hi>William Caton, Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Salthouſe, Mary Askew, Anne Clayton</hi> and ſeveral other Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. And I was ſtricken into ſuch a ſadneſs, I knew not what to do; my <hi>Husband</hi> being from home. I ſaw, it was the <hi>Truth,</hi> and I could not deny it; and I did, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> ſaith, I <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Truth in the Love of it:</hi> And it was opened to me ſo clear, that I had never a Tittle in my Heart againſt it; but I deſired the <hi>Lord,</hi> that I might be kept in it, and then I deſired no greater <hi>Portion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then he went on to <hi>Dalton, Aldingham, Dendrum</hi> and <hi>Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyde-Chappels</hi> and <hi>Steeple-houſes,</hi> and places ſeveral up and down, and the <hi>People</hi> followed him mightily; and abundance were <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,</hi> and ſaw, that which he ſpoke, was <hi>Truth:</hi> But the <hi>Prieſts</hi> were all in a Rage. And about <hi>two Weeks</hi> after <hi>James Naylor</hi> and <hi>Richard Farnſworth</hi> followed him, and enquired him out, till they came to <hi>Swarthmore,</hi> and there ſtayed a while with me at our Houſe, and did me much <hi>Good;</hi> for I was under <hi>great Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs</hi> and <hi>Judgment.</hi> But the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> entred upon me, within about <hi>two Weeks,</hi> that he came; and about <hi>three Weeks</hi>-end my <hi>Husband</hi> came home: And many were in a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>Rage.</hi> And a deal of the <hi>Captains</hi> and Great Ones of the Country went to <hi>meet</hi> my then <hi>Husband,</hi> as he was coming home, and informed him, <hi>That a Great Diſaſter was befallen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst his</hi> Family, <hi>and that they were</hi> Witches; <hi>and that they had taken us out of our</hi> Religion: <hi>and that he might either ſet them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, or all the</hi> Country <hi>would be undone.</hi> But no <hi>Weapons</hi> form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the <hi>Lord,</hi> ſhall proſper; as you may ſee hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>So my <hi>Husband</hi> came home greatly offended: And any may think, what a Condition I was like to be in, that either I might diſpleaſe my <hi>Husband,</hi> or offend <hi>God;</hi> for he was very much troubled with us all in the <hi>Houſe</hi> and <hi>Family,</hi> they had ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſt him againſt <hi>us.</hi> But <hi>James Naylor</hi> and <hi>Richard Farnſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> were both then at our <hi>Houſe,</hi> and I deſired them to come and ſpeak to him; and ſo they did, very <hi>moderately</hi> and <hi>wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi> But he was at firſt diſpleaſed with them; but they told him, <hi>They came in Love, and good Will to his Houſe.</hi> And after that he had heard them ſpeak a while, he was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſatisfied; and they offered, as if they would go away: but I <hi>deſired them</hi> to ſtay, and <hi>not to go away yet; for</hi> George Fox <hi>will come this Evening.</hi> And I would have had my <hi>Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band</hi> to have heard them all, and ſatisfied himſelf farther a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:51448:4"/> them; becauſe they had ſo prepoſſeſt him againſt them of ſuch <hi>dangerous, fearful things</hi> in his coming firſt home. And then was he pretty <hi>moderate</hi> and <hi>quiet:</hi> and his <hi>Dinner</hi> being ready, he went to it; and I went in, and ſate me down by him. And whilſt I was ſitting, the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> ſeized upon me: and he was ſtricken with <hi>Amazement,</hi> and knew not what to think; but was quiet and ſtill. And the <hi>Children</hi> were all quiet and ſtill, and grown Sober, and could not <hi>play</hi> on their <hi>Muſick,</hi> that they were learning: and all theſe things made him quiet and ſtill.</p>
            <p>And then at Night <hi>George Fox</hi> came: And after <hi>Supper</hi> my <hi>Husband</hi> was ſitting in the <hi>Parlour,</hi> and I asked him, <hi>If</hi> George Fox <hi>might come in?</hi> and he ſaid, <hi>Yes.</hi> So <hi>George</hi> came in with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Complement, and walked into the Room, and began to ſpeak preſently; and the Family, and <hi>James Naylor,</hi> and <hi>Richard Farnſworth</hi> came all in: and he ſpoke very excellently, as ever I heard him; and opened <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles Practices,</hi> which they were in, in their Day. And he opened the <hi>Night</hi> of <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy</hi> ſince the <hi>Apoſtles Days,</hi> and laid open the <hi>Priests</hi> and their Practices in the <hi>Apoſtacy;</hi> that if all in <hi>England</hi> had been there, I thought, they could not have denied the <hi>Truth</hi> of thoſe things. And ſo my <hi>Husband</hi> came to ſee clearly the <hi>Truth,</hi> of what he ſpoke, and was very quiet that Night, and ſaid no more; and went to Bed. And next Morning came <hi>Lampit, Priest</hi> of <hi>Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,</hi> and got my <hi>Husband</hi> into the <hi>Garden;</hi> and ſpake much to him there: But my <hi>Husband</hi> had ſeen ſo much the Night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the <hi>Prieſt</hi> got little Entrance upon him. And when the Prieſt <hi>Lampit</hi> was come into the Houſe, <hi>George</hi> ſpoke ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to him, and asked him; <hi>When God ſpake to him, and called him to go, and preach to the People?</hi> But after a while the <hi>Prieſt</hi> went away: This was on a <hi>Sixth-day</hi> of the <hi>Week</hi> about the <hi>Fifth Month,</hi> 1652. And at our Houſe divers <hi>Friends</hi> were ſpeaking one to another, how there was ſeveral <hi>Convinced</hi> here aways; and we could not tell, where to get a <hi>Meeting:</hi> My <hi>Husband</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo being preſent, he over-heard, and ſaid of his own Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord; <hi>You may Meet here, if you will:</hi> And that was the <hi>Firſt Meeting</hi> we had, that he offered of his own <hi>Accord.</hi> And then Notice was given that <hi>Day</hi> and the <hi>next</hi> to <hi>Friends;</hi> and there was a good large <hi>Meeting</hi> the <hi>Firſt-day,</hi> which was the <hi>Firſt Meeting,</hi> that was at <hi>Swarthmore:</hi> and ſo continued there a <hi>Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> from 1652, till 1690. And my <hi>Husband</hi> went that Day to the <hi>Steeple-houſe,</hi> and none with him, but his <hi>Clerk</hi> and his <hi>Groom,</hi> that rid with him; and the <hi>Prieſt</hi> and <hi>People</hi> were all fearfully <hi>troubled:</hi> But praiſed be the <hi>Lord,</hi> they never got their <hi>Wills</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us to this day.</p>
            <p>And then after a few <hi>Weeks, George</hi> went to <hi>Ulverſton-Steeple-houſe</hi> again, and the ſaid Juſtice <hi>Sawrey,</hi> with others, ſet the <hi>Rude Rabble</hi> upon him; and they beat him ſo, that he fell down as in a <hi>Swoon,</hi> and was ſore <hi>bruiſed</hi> and <hi>black'ned</hi> in his <hi>Body,</hi> and on his <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Arms.</hi> Then my Husband was not at home: but when he came home, he was diſpleaſed, that they ſhould do ſo;
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:51448:4"/> and ſpoke to Juſtice <hi>Sawrey,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>It was againſt</hi> Law <hi>to make Riots.</hi> And after that he was ſore beat and ſtoned at <hi>Walney,</hi> till he fell down: And alſo at <hi>Dalton</hi> was he ſore <hi>beat</hi> and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; ſo that he had very hard Uſage in divers places in theſe parts. And then when a <hi>Meeting</hi> was ſettled here, he went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into <hi>Weſtmorland,</hi> and ſettled <hi>Meetings</hi> there; and there was a great <hi>Convincement,</hi> and abundance of brave <hi>Miniſters</hi> came out there-aways, as <hi>John Camm, John Audland, Francis Howgil, Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Burrough, Miles Halhead,</hi> and <hi>John Blaykling</hi> with divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. He alſo went over Sands to <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and <hi>Yelland,</hi> and <hi>Kellet,</hi> where <hi>Robert Widders, Richard Hubberthorn</hi> and <hi>John Lawſon,</hi> with many others were <hi>Convinced.</hi> And about that time he was in thoſe parts, many <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Profeſſors</hi> roſe up, and falſly accuſed him for <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> and did endeavour to <hi>take away</hi> his <hi>Life;</hi> and got People to <hi>ſwear</hi> at a <hi>Seſſions</hi> at <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> that he had ſpoken <hi>Blaſphemy.</hi> But my then <hi>Husband</hi> and Colonel <hi>Weſt,</hi> having had ſome <hi>Sight</hi> and <hi>Knowledge</hi> of the <hi>Truth,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the <hi>two</hi> Perſecuting Juſtices, <hi>John Sawrey</hi> and <hi>Thompſon;</hi> and brought him off, and cleared him: for indeed he was <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</hi> And after the <hi>Seſſions</hi> there was a great <hi>Meeting</hi> in the Town of <hi>Lancaſter;</hi> and many of the <hi>Towns People</hi> came in, and many were <hi>Convinced.</hi> And thus he was up and down about <hi>Lancaſter, Yelland, Weſtmorland</hi> and ſome parts of <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> and our parts above one <hi>Year;</hi> in which time there was above <hi>Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and <hi>four Miniſters</hi> brought forth, that were ready to go with their <hi>Testimony</hi> of the <hi>Eternal Truth</hi> unto the <hi>World:</hi> And ſoon after <hi>Francis Howgil</hi> and <hi>John Camm</hi> went to ſpeak to <hi>Oliver Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the Year 1653. <hi>George</hi>'s drawings was into <hi>Cumberland</hi> by <hi>Milholm, Lampley, Embleton</hi> and <hi>Brigham, Pardſey</hi> and <hi>Cocker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> where at or near <hi>Embleton</hi> he had a <hi>Diſpute</hi> with ſome <hi>Prieſts,</hi> as <hi>Larkham</hi> and <hi>Benſon,</hi> but chiefly with <hi>John Wilkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> a <hi>Preacher</hi> at <hi>Embleton</hi> and <hi>Brigham;</hi> who after was <hi>Convinced,</hi> and owned the <hi>Truth,</hi> and was a ſerviceable <hi>Miniſter</hi> both in <hi>England, Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi> And then he went to <hi>Coldbeck</hi> and ſeveral places, till he came to <hi>Carliſle,</hi> and went to their <hi>Steeple-houſe:</hi> And they <hi>beat</hi> and <hi>abuſed</hi> him, and had him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Magiſtrates;</hi> who Examined him,<note place="margin">The <hi>third</hi> Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> and put him in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon there in the <hi>Common-Goal</hi> among the Thieves.

            <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:51448:5"/>
            <p>And in the Year 1654. he went <hi>Southward</hi> to his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Leicesterſhire,</hi> viſiting <hi>Friends.</hi> And then Colonel <hi>Hacker</hi> ſent him to <hi>Oliver Cromwel:</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>fourth</hi> Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> and after his being kept <hi>Priſoner</hi> a while, he was brought before <hi>Oliver,</hi> and was <hi>Releaſed.</hi> And then he ſtayed a while, viſiting <hi>Friends</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> and the <hi>Meetings</hi> therein; and ſo paſſed Weſtward to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and viſited <hi>Friends</hi> there: and after went into <hi>Cornwal,</hi> where they put him in <hi>Priſon</hi> at <hi>Launceſton,</hi>

And when we got it, we ſent it down to <hi>Worceſter;</hi> and they would not part with him at firſt, but ſaid, he was <hi>Premunired, and was not to go out on that manner.</hi> And then we were forced to go to Judge <hi>North,</hi> and to the <hi>Attorney General,</hi> and we got another <hi>Order,</hi> and ſent down from them; and with much ado, and great Labour and Induſtry of <hi>William Mead,</hi> and other <hi>Friends,</hi> we got him up to <hi>London,</hi> where he <hi>Appeared</hi> in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall</hi> at the <hi>King</hi>'s-<hi>Bench,</hi> before Judge <hi>Hales,</hi> who was a very honeſt, tender Man; and he knew, they had <hi>Impriſoned</hi> him but in <hi>Envy.</hi> So that, which they had againſt him, was <hi>Read;</hi> and our <hi>Counſel</hi> pleaded, <hi>That he was taken up in his Travel and Journey:</hi> And there was but a little ſaid, till he was <hi>quitted.</hi> And this was the <hi>Laſt Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> that he was in, being freed by the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>King</hi>'s-<hi>Bench.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when he was at Liberty, he <hi>Recovered</hi> again: And then I was very deſirous to go home with him, which we did. And this was the <hi>firſt time,</hi> that he came to <hi>Swarthmore,</hi> after we were <hi>Married;</hi> and ſo he ſtayed here much of <hi>two years.</hi> And then went to <hi>London</hi> again to the <hi>Yearly Meeting;</hi> and after a while went into <hi>Holland,</hi> and ſome parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> where he ſtayed a pretty while: and then Returned to <hi>London</hi> again at the next <hi>Yearly Meeting.</hi> And after he had ſtayed a while in and about <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> he came into the <hi>North</hi> to <hi>Swarthmore</hi> again; and ſtayed
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:51448:6"/> that time nigh <hi>two years:</hi> And then he grew <hi>weakly,</hi> being troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with <hi>Pains</hi> and <hi>Aches,</hi> having had many <hi>ſore</hi> and <hi>long Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, Beatings,</hi> and <hi>hard Impriſonments.</hi> But after ſome time he rid to <hi>York:</hi> and ſo paſſed on thorow <hi>Nottinghamſhire</hi> and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Counties,</hi> viſiting <hi>Friends;</hi> till he came to <hi>London</hi> to the <hi>Yearly-Meeting,</hi> and ſtayed there, and there-aways, till he <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed</hi> his <hi>Courſe,</hi> and laid down his <hi>Head</hi> in <hi>Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though the <hi>Lord</hi> had provided an outward <hi>Habitation</hi> for him, yet he was not willing to ſtay at it; becauſe it was ſo <hi>remote</hi> and <hi>far</hi> from <hi>London,</hi> where his <hi>Service</hi> moſt lay. And my <hi>Concern</hi> for <hi>God,</hi> and his holy, Eternal <hi>Truth</hi> was then in the <hi>North,</hi> where <hi>God</hi> had placed and ſet me; and likewiſe for the <hi>Ordering</hi> and <hi>Governing</hi> of my <hi>Children</hi> and <hi>Family:</hi> ſo that we were very willing <hi>both</hi> of us, to live <hi>a-part</hi> ſome years up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Account,</hi> and his <hi>Truth</hi>'s <hi>Service,</hi> and to deny our ſelves of that <hi>Comfort,</hi> which we might have had in being together, for the ſake and <hi>Service</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and his <hi>Truth.</hi> And if any took Occaſion, or Judged hard of us becauſe of that, the <hi>Lord</hi> will <hi>Judge</hi> them; for we were <hi>Innocent.</hi> And for my own part, I was willing to make many <hi>long Journies,</hi> for ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away all <hi>Occaſion</hi> of <hi>evil Thoughts:</hi> And though I lived <hi>Two hundred Miles</hi> from <hi>London,</hi> yet have I been <hi>Nine times</hi> there, upon the <hi>Lord,</hi> and his <hi>Truth</hi>'s <hi>Account;</hi> and of all the times that I was at <hi>London,</hi> this <hi>laſt time</hi> was moſt <hi>Comfortable,</hi> that the <hi>Lord</hi> was pleaſed to give me <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Ability,</hi> to travel that <hi>great Journey,</hi> being <hi>Seventy ſix years</hi> of <hi>Age,</hi> to ſee my <hi>Dear Husband,</hi> who was better in his <hi>Health</hi> and <hi>Strength,</hi> than many times I had ſeen him before. I look upon that, that the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>ſpecial Hand</hi> was in it, that I ſhould go then; for he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved but about <hi>half</hi> a <hi>Year</hi> after I left him: Which makes me admire the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in Ordering my <hi>Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi> at that time.</p>
            <p>And now he hath <hi>finiſhed</hi> his <hi>Courſe,</hi> and his <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> and is entered into his Eternal <hi>Rest</hi> and <hi>Felicity.</hi> I truſt in the ſame <hi>powerful God,</hi> that his <hi>holy Arm</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> will carry me tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, whatever he hath yet for me to do; and that he will be my <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Support,</hi> and the <hi>Bearer</hi> up of my <hi>Head</hi> unto the <hi>End,</hi> and in the <hi>End.</hi> For I know his <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> and <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and I have <hi>Experience</hi> of his <hi>Love;</hi> To whom be <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Powerful Dominion</hi> for ever: <hi>Amen.</hi>

Howbeit, O <hi>Dear Brethren</hi> and <hi>Friends!</hi> that ſo many <hi>Worthies</hi> in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſerviceable <hi>Inſtruments</hi> in the Lord's Hand, are of late taken away and removed from us, ſo ſoon one after another, appears a <hi>Diſpenſation,</hi> that deeply and ſorrowfully affects us, and many more, whoſe Hearts are upright and tender toward God, and one to another in the <hi>Truth.</hi> The Conſideration of the <hi>Depth, Weight</hi> and <hi>Meaning</hi> thereof, is very weighty upon our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, though their precious <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Teſtimony</hi> lives with us, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that ſame <hi>Body,</hi> united to one <hi>Head,</hi> even Chriſt Jeſus; in which we ſtill, and hope, ever ſhall have ſecret <hi>Comfort</hi> and <hi>Union</hi> with them, whom the Lord has removed, and taken to himſelf out of their Earthly <hi>Tabernacles</hi> and <hi>Houſes,</hi> into their Heavenly and Everlaſting Manſions.</p>
            <p>This our ſaid Dear Brother, <hi>George Fox,</hi> was enabled by the Lord's Power, to <hi>Preach</hi> the <hi>Truth</hi> fully and effectually, in our Publick Meeting in <hi>White-Hart-Court,</hi> by <hi>Grace-Church-ſtreet, Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> on the <hi>Eleventh Day</hi> of this inſtant 11th <hi>Month,</hi> 1690: After which he ſaid, <hi>I am glad I was here; now I am clear, I am fully clear.</hi> Then he was the ſame Day taken with ſome <hi>Illneſs</hi> or <hi>Indiſpoſition</hi> of <hi>Body,</hi> more than uſual; and continued <hi>weak</hi> in <hi>Body</hi> for <hi>two days</hi> after, at our Friend <hi>Henry Goldney</hi>'s Houſe in the ſame Court, cloſe by the <hi>Meeting-Houſe,</hi> in much Contentment and Peace, and very ſenſible to the laſt. In which time he mentioned divers <hi>Friends,</hi> and ſent for ſome in particular; to whom he expreſt his <hi>Mind,</hi> for the ſpreading <hi>Friends Books</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> in the <hi>World,</hi> and through the <hi>Nations</hi> thereof; as his Spirit in the Lord's Love and Power was uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally ſet, and bent for <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> and the making known the <hi>Way</hi> thereof to the Nations and People afar off: ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying alſo to ſome Friends, <hi>That all is well; and the Seed of God reigns over all, and over Death it ſelf. That though he was weak in Body, yet that the Power of God is over all, and the Seed reigns over all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly Spirits:</hi> which were his wonted ſenſible Expreſſions, being in the living <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Senſe</hi> thereof, which he kept to the End. And the <hi>Thirteenth</hi> Inſtant, between the <hi>Ninth</hi> and <hi>Tenth Hour</hi> in the <hi>Night,</hi> he quietly departed this Life in Peace; being <hi>two days</hi>
               <pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:51448:8"/> after the Lord enabled him to <hi>Publiſh</hi> and <hi>Preach</hi> the <hi>Bleſſed Truth</hi> in the <hi>Meeting,</hi> as aforeſaid. So that he clearly and evidently ended his days in his <hi>faithful Teſtimony,</hi> in perfect Love and Unity with his <hi>Brethren,</hi> and Peace and Good-will to all Men; being about <hi>Sixty</hi> and <hi>ſix Years</hi> of Age (as we underſtand) when he departed this Life.</p>
            <p>And on the <hi>Sixteenth</hi> of this <hi>Inſtant,</hi> being the day appointed for his <hi>Funeral,</hi> a very great <hi>Concourſe</hi> of <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>People</hi> aſſembled at our Meeting-Houſe in <hi>White-Hart-Court</hi> aforeſaid, about the <hi>Mid-day,</hi> in order to attend his Body to our Burying-place near <hi>Bunhill-Fields,</hi> to be Interred, as <hi>Friends laſt Office</hi> of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Reſpect,</hi> due on that Account. The <hi>Meeting</hi> was held about <hi>two Hours,</hi> with great and heavenly Solemnity, manifeſtly attended with the <hi>Lord</hi>'s Bleſſed <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Preſence;</hi> and divers living <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> given from a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Remembrance and Senſe of this his <hi>Dear, Ancient Servant,</hi> his Bleſſed <hi>Miniſtry</hi> and <hi>Testimony</hi> of the breaking forth of this <hi>Goſpel-day;</hi> his <hi>Innocent Life,</hi> long and great <hi>Travels,</hi> and <hi>Labours</hi> of <hi>Love</hi> in the Everlaſting Goſpel, for the turning and gathering many <hi>Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands</hi> from <hi>Darkneſs</hi> to the <hi>Light</hi> of Chriſt Jeſus, the Foundation of true <hi>Faith;</hi> alſo of his manifold <hi>Sufferings, Afflictions</hi> and <hi>Oppoſitions,</hi> which he met withal for his faithful <hi>Testimony,</hi> both from his open <hi>Adverſaries</hi> and <hi>falſe Brethren;</hi> and his Preſervations, Dominion, and <hi>Deliverances</hi> out of them all by the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God:</hi> To whom the Glory and Honour was and is aſcribed, in raiſing up and preſerving <hi>this</hi> his faithful <hi>Witneſs</hi> and <hi>Miniſter</hi> to the End of his Days; whoſe bleſſed <hi>Memorial</hi> will Everlaſtingly remain.</p>
            <p>He loved <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> and bore faithful Teſtimony againſt <hi>Deceit</hi> and <hi>Falſhood,</hi> and the <hi>Myſtery</hi> of <hi>Iniquity:</hi> and often, of late time eſpecially, warned <hi>Friends</hi> againſt <hi>Covetouſneſs, Earthly-mindedneſs,</hi> againſt getting into the <hi>Earth,</hi> and into a <hi>brittle Spirit;</hi> and the younger ſort, againſt <hi>Looſneſs</hi> and <hi>Pride</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>A few days before he <hi>died,</hi> he had a great <hi>Concern</hi> upon his <hi>Mind,</hi> concerning ſome, in whom the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Power</hi> was working, to lead them into a <hi>Miniſtry</hi> and <hi>Teſtimony</hi> to his <hi>Truth;</hi> who through their too much entangling themſelves in the <hi>things</hi> of this <hi>World,</hi> did make themſelves unready to anſwer the <hi>Call</hi> and <hi>Leadings</hi> of the Power of God, and hurt the <hi>Gift,</hi> that was beſtowed upon them, and did not take that regard to their <hi>Service</hi> and <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> as they ought: And mentioned the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s <hi>Exhortation</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> To <hi>take heed to his Miniſtry, and to ſhew himſelf approved,</hi> &amp;c. And expreſt his <hi>Grief</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſuch, as preferred their own Buſineſs before the <hi>Lord</hi>'s Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſought the advancing worldly Concerns, before the <hi>Concerns</hi> of <hi>Truth:</hi> And concluded with a tender and fatherly <hi>Exhortation</hi> to all, to whom God had imparted of his <hi>Heavenly Treaſure,</hi> that they would <hi>improve</hi> it faithfully; and be diligent in the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Work,</hi> that the Earth might be ſown with the <hi>Seed</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Harvest</hi> might be minded by thoſe, whom he had called and enabled to labour therein: and that ſuch would commit the <hi>Care</hi> of their outward Concerns to the Lord, who would care for them, and give a <hi>Bleſſing</hi> to them. However, this is not mentioned to encourage any to run <hi>unſent,</hi> or without being <hi>called</hi> of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many are living <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> that the <hi>Lord</hi> raiſed him up by his
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:51448:9"/> 
               <hi>Power,</hi> to proclaim his mighry <hi>Day</hi> to the <hi>Nations,</hi> and made him an Effectual <hi>Inſtrument</hi> in our Day, to turn many from <hi>Darkneſs</hi> to <hi>Light,</hi> and from <hi>Satan</hi>'s <hi>Power</hi> to <hi>God;</hi> and freely to ſuffer and bear all <hi>Reproaches,</hi> and the manifold <hi>Perſecutions, Buffetings, Halings, Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, Impriſonments,</hi> and <hi>Cruelties,</hi> that were in the Beginning, and for ſome time inflicted on him and others, for the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> He was in his Teſtimony as a <hi>fixed Star</hi> in the Firmament of God's Power, where all that be truly wiſe, and that turn many to Righteouſneſs, ſhall ſhine as the brightneſs of the Firmament, and as the <hi>Stars</hi> for ever and ever. He knew and Preached the <hi>Mystery</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> Revealed, the <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Subſtance,</hi> and the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> above all <hi>Shadows</hi> and <hi>Forms:</hi> The Lord endued him with a hidden <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Life.</hi> He loved <hi>Peace,</hi> and earneſtly laboured for univerſal <hi>Love, Unity, Peace,</hi> and good <hi>Order</hi> in the Churches of Chriſt: And wherever he met with the contrary, it was his great <hi>Grief</hi> and <hi>Burthen.</hi> He was greatly for the Encouragement of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Labourers</hi> in the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Work;</hi> and it was a great <hi>Offence</hi> and <hi>Grief</hi> to him, to have their <hi>Teſtimony</hi> weakned, or <hi>Labours</hi> ſlighted through <hi>Prejudice</hi> in any profeſſing <hi>Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And inaſmuch as the <hi>Lord</hi> ſuffered him not to be delivered up to the <hi>Will</hi> of his <hi>Enemies</hi> and <hi>Perſecutors,</hi> who often heretofore breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out <hi>Cruelty</hi> againſt him, and deſigned his <hi>Deſtruction;</hi> but in his <hi>good Pleaſure</hi> ſo fairly and quietly took him away in his own time, when his <hi>Teſtimony</hi> was ſo bleſſedly <hi>finiſhed,</hi> and his <hi>Work accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> This is all remarkable, and worthy of ſerious and due Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as being by a ſpecial and <hi>Divine Providence</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> to whom we aſcribe the Glory of all, and not unto <hi>Man</hi> or <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi> Though we muſt needs allow, and own that <hi>good Report</hi> and <hi>due Esteem,</hi> which faithful <hi>Elders, Miniſters</hi> and <hi>Servants</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> have by Faith obtained, to the Praiſe of that bleſſed Power, that upheld them in every Age in their day; many whereof are even of late taken away from the <hi>Evil</hi> to come, and are at <hi>Reſt</hi> in the <hi>Lord,</hi> out of the Reach of all <hi>Envy</hi> and <hi>Perſecution,</hi> where the Wicked can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not trouble them any more.</p>
            <p>And we muſt patiently bear our <hi>Parting</hi> with them, and our <hi>Loſs</hi> and <hi>Sorrow</hi> on that <hi>Account,</hi> with reſpect to their unſpeakable <hi>Gain:</hi> Yet how can we avoid being deeply affected with <hi>Sadneſs</hi> of <hi>Spirit,</hi> and brokenneſs of Heart, under the ſenſe and conſideration of ſuch Loſs and Revolutions, which we have cauſe to believe are <hi>Ominous</hi> of <hi>Calamities</hi> to the wicked World, though of good to the Righteous?

            <head>THE PREFACE, BEING A SUMMARY ACCOUNT Of the DIVERS <hi>Diſpenſations of God</hi> TO MEN, FROM The Beginning of the World to That of our preſent Age, by the Miniſtry and Teſtimony of his Faithful Servant <hi>George Fox,</hi> as an Introduction to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing <hi>Iournal.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>DIVERS have been the <hi>Diſpenſations</hi> of God ſince the Creation of the <hi>World</hi> unto the Sons of <hi>Men;</hi> But the Great <hi>End</hi> of all of them has been the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown of his own Excellent Name in the Creation and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration of Man:</hi> Man, the <hi>Emblem</hi> of himſelf, as a God on Earth and the <hi>Glory</hi> of all his Works. The World began with <hi>Innocency:</hi> All was then good that the good God had made: And as he bleſſed the Works of his hands, ſo their <hi>Natures</hi> and <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> magnified him their <hi>Creator.</hi> Then the Morning Stars Sang to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb facs="tcp:51448:12"/> for <hi>Joy,</hi> and all parts of his Works ſaid <hi>Amen</hi> to his <hi>Law.</hi> Not a <hi>Jarr</hi> in the whole Frame, but Man in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> the <hi>Beaſts</hi> in the <hi>Field,</hi> the <hi>Fowl</hi> in the <hi>Air,</hi> the <hi>Fiſh</hi> in the <hi>Sea,</hi> the <hi>Lights</hi> in the <hi>Heavens,</hi> the <hi>Fruits</hi> of the <hi>Earth;</hi> yea the <hi>Air,</hi> the <hi>Earth,</hi> the <hi>Water</hi> and <hi>Fire</hi> Worſhipped, praiſed and exalted his Power, Wiſdom and Goodneſs. O <hi>Holy Sabbath,</hi> O <hi>Holy Day</hi> to the Lord!</p>
            <p>But this Happy State laſted not long: For Man, the Crown and Glory of the Whole, being tempted to aſpire <hi>above</hi> his place, unhappily yielded againſt <hi>Command</hi> and <hi>Duty,</hi> as well as <hi>Intereſt</hi> and <hi>Felicity;</hi> and ſo fell below it, loſt the Divine I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, the Wiſdom, Power and Purity he was made in. By which, being no longer fit for <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> he was <hi>expelled</hi> that Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of God, his proper Dwelling and Reſidence, and was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out, as a poor <hi>Vagabond,</hi> from the preſence of the Lord, to wander in the Earth, the Habitation of <hi>Beaſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet God, that made him had pitty on him; for He ſeeing he was deceived, and that it was not of <hi>Malice,</hi> or an <hi>Original Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption</hi> in him, but through the Subtilty of the <hi>Serpent,</hi> (that had firſt fallen from his own State, and by the Mediation of the <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> man's own Nature and Companion, whom the Serpent had firſt deluded) in his infinite Goodneſs and Wiſdom found out a way to <hi>Repair</hi> the <hi>Breach, Recover</hi> the <hi>Loſs,</hi> and <hi>Reſtore</hi> fallen Man again by a <hi>Nobler and more Excellent</hi> Adam, promiſed to be born of a <hi>Woman;</hi> that as by means of a <hi>Woman</hi> the evil one had prevailed upon <hi>Man,</hi> by a <hi>Woman</hi> alſo He ſhould come into the World, who would <hi>prevail</hi> againſt him and <hi>bruiſe his Head,</hi> and deliver Man from his Power: And which, in a ſignal manner, by the Diſpenſation of the Son of God in the Fleſh, in the fullneſs of Time, was <hi>perſonally</hi> and <hi>fully</hi> accompliſhed by him, and in him, as Man's <hi>Saviour</hi> and <hi>Redeemer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But his Power was not limitted, in the <hi>Manifeſtation</hi> of it, to that time; for both <hi>before</hi> and <hi>ſince</hi> his bleſſed <hi>Manifeſtation</hi> in the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> He has been the <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> the <hi>Rock</hi> and <hi>Strength</hi> of all that ever feared God: Preſent with them in their Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, followed them in their Travels and Afflictions, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported and carried them through and over the Difficulties that have attended them in their <hi>Earthly Pilgrimage.</hi> By this <hi>Abel</hi>'s heart excelled <hi>Cains,</hi> and <hi>Seth</hi> obtained the preheminence, and <hi>Enoch</hi> walked with God. It was this that ſtrove with the <hi>Old World,</hi> and which they rebelled againſt, and which ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and inſtructed <hi>Noah</hi> to Salvation.</p>
            <p>But the outward <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> that followed the benighted <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Man,</hi> after his Fall, eſpecially among the <hi>Patriarcks,</hi> was generally that of <hi>Angels;</hi> as the Scriptures of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> do in many places expreſs, as to <hi>Abraham, Jacob,</hi> &amp;c. The next
<pb facs="tcp:51448:12"/> was that of the Law by <hi>Moſes,</hi> which was alſo delivered by <hi>Angels,</hi> as the Apoſtle tells us. This <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> was much outward, and ſuited to a low and ſervil State; called there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that of a <hi>School-Maſter,</hi> to point out and prepare that People to look and long for the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> who would deliver them from the ſervitude of a <hi>Ceremonious</hi> and imperfect <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation,</hi> by knowing the Realities of thoſe Miſterious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations in themſelves. In this time the Law was written on <hi>Stone,</hi> the Temple built with <hi>Hands</hi> attended with an outward <hi>Prieſt-hood</hi> and <hi>External Rites,</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> that were <hi>Shadows of the Good Things that were to come,</hi> and were only to ſerve till the <hi>Seed</hi> came, or the more excellent and general manifeſtation of Chriſt, to whom was the Promiſe, and to all Men only in him, in whom it was <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Amen;</hi> even <hi>Life</hi> from <hi>Death, Immortality</hi> and <hi>Eternal Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This the <hi>Prophets</hi> foreſaw, and comforted the believing <hi>Jews</hi> in the certainty of it; which was the <hi>Top</hi> of the Moſaical <hi>Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,</hi> and which ended in <hi>John</hi>'s Miniſtry, the Forerunner of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> as <hi>John</hi>'s was finiſhed in him, the <hi>Fullneſs</hi> of all. And God, that at ſundry Times and in divers manners had ſpoken to the Fathers by his Servants the Prophets, Spoak then by his <hi>Son Chr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt Jeſus, Who is Heir of all things;</hi> being the Goſpel-Day, which is the Diſpenſation of <hi>Sonſhip:</hi> Bringing in thereby a near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Teſtament and a better hope; even the <hi>beginning</hi> of the <hi>Glory</hi> of the latter days, and of the <hi>Reſtitution</hi> of all things; yea, the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration of the Kingdom unto</hi> Iſrael.</p>
            <p>Now the Spirit, that was more ſparingly communicated in former Diſpenſations, began to be <hi>Poured forth upon all Fleſh,</hi> according to the Prophet <hi>Joel,</hi> and the <hi>Light</hi> that ſhined in <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> or but <hi>dimly before,</hi> the moſt gracious God cauſed to <hi>Shine out of Darkneſs,</hi> and the <hi>Day-ſtar</hi> began to ariſe in the <hi>Hearts</hi> of <hi>Believers,</hi> giving unto them the knowledge of God in the Face (or Appearance) of his <hi>Son Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Poor</hi> in <hi>Spirit,</hi> the <hi>Meek,</hi> the true <hi>Mourners,</hi> the <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry</hi> and <hi>Thirſty</hi> after <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> the <hi>Peace-makers,</hi> the <hi>Pure in Heart,</hi> the <hi>Merciful</hi> and the <hi>Perſecuted,</hi> came more eſpecially in Remembrance before the Lord, and were ſought out and bleſſed by <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s true <hi>Shepherd.</hi> Old <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with her Children grew out of Date, and the New <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> into Requeſt, the <hi>Mother</hi> of the Sons of the <hi>Goſpel-Day.</hi> Wherefore no more at Old <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> nor at the Mountain of <hi>Samaria,</hi> will God be worſhipped above other places; for, behold, he is declared and preached a <hi>Spirit,</hi> and he will be known as ſuch, and worſhipped in the <hi>Spirit</hi> and in the <hi>Truth.</hi> He will come nearer then of old time, and he will write his <hi>Law</hi> in the <hi>Heart,</hi> and put his Fear and Spirit in the <hi>inward parts,</hi> according to his promiſe. Then <hi>Signs, Types</hi> and <hi>Shadows</hi> flew away, the Day having diſcovered their Inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency
<pb facs="tcp:51448:13"/> in not reaching to the inſide of the <hi>Cup,</hi> to the <hi>cleanſing</hi> of the Conſcience; and all Elementary ſervices were expired in and and by him that is the ſubſtance of all.</p>
            <p>And to this Great and Bleſſed End of the Diſpenſation of the Son of God, did the Apoſtles Teſtifie, whom he had choſen and anointed by his Spirit, to turn the <hi>Jews</hi> from their Prejudice and Superſtition, and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> from their Vanity and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, to Chriſt's <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> that ſhined in them; that they might be <hi>quickned</hi> from the Sins and Treſpaſſes in which they were Dead, to ſerve the Living God in the <hi>Newneſs</hi> of the Spirit of Life, and walk as Children of the <hi>Light,</hi> and of the <hi>Day,</hi> even the <hi>Day</hi> of <hi>Holineſs:</hi> For ſuch <hi>put on Chriſt,</hi> the Light of the World, <hi>and make no more Proviſion for the Fleſh, to fulfil the Luſts thereof.</hi> So that the <hi>Light, Spirit</hi> and <hi>Grace that comes</hi> by Chriſt, and appears in Man, was what the Apoſtles mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred from, and turned Peoples Minds unto, and in which they gathered and built up the Churches of Chriſt in their Day. For which cauſe they adviſed them not to <hi>quench</hi> the <hi>Spirit,</hi> but <hi>wait</hi> for the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Speak</hi> by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Pray</hi> by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Walk</hi> in the <hi>Spirit</hi> too, as that which approved them the truly begotten Children of God; <hi>born, not of Fleſh and Blood, or of the will of Man, but of the will of God;</hi> by doing his will, and denying their own; by drinking of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Cup,</hi> and being Baptized with <hi>his Baptiſm</hi> of <hi>Self-denial:</hi> The Way and Path that all the Heirs of Life have trod to Bleſſedneſs. But alas! even in the Apoſtles Days, (thoſe bright Stars of the <hi>firſt</hi> Magnitude of the Goſpel Light) ſome Clouds (foretelling an <hi>Eclipſe</hi> of this Primitive Glory) began to appear, and ſeveral of them gave early Caution of it to the Chriſtians of their Time; that even then there was, and yet would be more and more, a <hi>falling away</hi> from the Power of Godlineſs and the Purity of that Spiritual Diſpenſation, by ſuch as ſought to make a fair <hi>ſhew in the Fleſh,</hi> but with whom the offence of the Croſs ceaſed: Yet with this comfortable Concluſion, that they ſaw beyond it a more glorious Time than ever, to the true Church. Their ſight was true, and what they foretold to the Churches, gathered by them in the Name and Power of Jeſus, came ſo to paſs: For Chriſtians degenerated a-pace into outſides, as <hi>Days</hi> and <hi>Meats,</hi> and divers other <hi>Cerimonies.</hi> And which was worſe, they fell into <hi>Strife</hi> and <hi>Contention</hi> about them, <hi>ſeparating</hi> one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then <hi>Envying,</hi> and, as they had Power, <hi>Perſecuting</hi> one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to the ſhame and ſcandal of their common Chriſtianity, and grievous ſtumbling and offence of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> among whom the Lord had ſo long and ſo marvellouſly preſerved them. And having got at laſt the Worldly Power into their Hands, by Kings and Emperors embracing the <hi>Chriſtian Profeſſion,</hi> they changed what they could, the Kingdom of Chriſt, which is not of this World, into a <hi>Worldly Kingdom;</hi> or at leaſt ſtiled the <hi>Worldly Kingdom</hi> that was in their Hands the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:51448:13"/> and ſo they became <hi>Worldly,</hi> and not true Chriſtians. Then <hi>Humane Inventions</hi> and <hi>Novelties,</hi> both in <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Worſhip,</hi> crowded faſt into the Church; a Door being opened thereunto by the Groſſneſs and Carnality that appeared then among the generality of Chriſtians; who had long ſince left the Guidance of God's meek and heavenly Spirit, and given themſelves up to <hi>Superſtition, Will-worſhip,</hi> and <hi>Voluntary Humility.</hi> And as <hi>Superſtition</hi> is <hi>Blind,</hi> ſo it is <hi>Heady</hi> and <hi>Furious;</hi> for all muſt ſtoop to its blind and boundleſs <hi>Zeal</hi> or <hi>Periſh</hi> by it: In the Name of the Spirit, perſecuting the very appearance of the Spirit of God in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and oppoſing that in them which they reſiſted in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Light, Grace</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> but always under the Notion of <hi>Innovation, Hereſie, Schiſm,</hi> or ſome ſuch plauſible Name. Though Chriſtianity allows of no Name or Pretence whatever for perſecuting of any Man for matters of meer Religion; Religion being in its very Nature, <hi>Meek, Gentle</hi> and <hi>Forbearing;</hi> and conſiſts of <hi>Faith, Hope</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> which no Perſecutor can have, whilſt he remains a Perſecutor; in that a Man cannot believe well, or hope well, or have a charitable or tender regard to another, whilſt he would <hi>violate</hi> his mind or <hi>perſecute</hi> his <hi>Body</hi> for matters of <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Worſhip</hi> towards his God.</p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>Falſe Church</hi> ſprang up, and mounted the <hi>Chair.</hi> But though ſhe loſt her <hi>Nature,</hi> ſhe would keep her good Name of the <hi>Lambs-bride,</hi> the <hi>True Church</hi> and <hi>Mother</hi> of the <hi>Faithful;</hi> conſtraining all to receive her <hi>Mark,</hi> either in their Forehead or Righthand, publickly or privately: But Indeed and in Truth ſhe was <hi>Myſtery Babylon,</hi> the <hi>Mother of Harlots:</hi> Mother of thoſe that with all their ſhow and outſide of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, were adulterated and gone from the <hi>Spirit,</hi> Nature and Life of Chriſt, and grown <hi>Vain, Worldly, Ambitious, Covetous, Cruel,</hi> &amp;c. which are the Fruits of the <hi>Fleſh</hi> and not of the <hi>Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now it was that the True Church fled into the <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> that is, from <hi>Superſtition</hi> and <hi>Violence,</hi> to a <hi>Retired, Solitary</hi> and <hi>lonely State;</hi> hidden and as it <hi>were out of Sight</hi> of Men, though not out of the World: Which ſhows that her wonted <hi>Viſibility</hi> was not <hi>Eſſential</hi> to the Being of a <hi>True Church</hi> in the Judgment of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> ſhe being as True a Church in the <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> though not as <hi>Viſible</hi> and <hi>Luſtrious,</hi> as when ſhe was in her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Splendor of Profeſſion. In this State many <hi>Attempts</hi> She made to return, but the Waters were yet too High, and her way blocked up, and many of her excellent Children in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Nations</hi> and <hi>Centuries</hi> fell by the Cruelty of <hi>Superſtition,</hi> becauſe they would not fall from their <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> to the Truth.</p>

            <p>The laſt Age did ſet ſome ſteps towards it, both as to <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Practice.</hi> But <hi>Practice</hi> quickly failed, for <hi>Wickedneſs</hi> flowed in a little time, as well among the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of the <hi>Reformation</hi> as thoſe they reformed from; ſo that by the <hi>Fruits</hi> of <hi>Converſation</hi> they were not to be diſtinguiſhed. And the Children of the <hi>Reformers,</hi> if not the <hi>Reformers</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, betook themſelves very early to <hi>Earthly Policy</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> to uphold and carry on their <hi>Reformation</hi> that had been begun with <hi>Spiritual Weapons;</hi> which I have often thought, has been one of the greateſt reaſons the Reformation made no better <hi>Progreſs,</hi> as to the <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Soul</hi> of Religion: For whilſt the <hi>Reformers</hi> were <hi>Lowly</hi> and <hi>Spiritually Minded,</hi> and truſted in <hi>God,</hi> and lookt to <hi>Him,</hi> and lived in his <hi>Fear,</hi> and conſulted not with <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> nor ſought Deliverance in their own way, there were daily added to the Church ſuch as, one might reaſonably ſay, ſhould be ſaved. For they were not ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be ſafe from <hi>Perſecution</hi> as to be Faithful under it.</p>
            <p>Being more concerned to ſpread the <hi>Truth</hi> by their <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Patience</hi> in <hi>Tribulation,</hi> than to get the worldly Power out of their Hands that inflicted their Sufferings upon them; and it will be well if the Lord ſuffer them not to fall by the <hi>very ſame way</hi> they took to ſtand. In <hi>Doctrine</hi> they were in ſome things ſhort, in other things, to avoid one extream they run into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And for <hi>Worſhip,</hi> there was for the generality, more of <hi>Man</hi> than <hi>God.</hi> They owned the <hi>Spirit, Inſpiration</hi> and <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> indeed, and grounded their <hi>Seperation</hi> and <hi>Reformation</hi> upon the <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> they received from it, in the <hi>Reading</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> of <hi>Truth;</hi> and this was their Plea, <hi>the Scripture was the</hi> Text, <hi>the Spirit the</hi> Interpreter, <hi>and that to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one for himſelf.</hi> But yet there was too much of humane <hi>Invention, Tradition</hi> and <hi>Art</hi> that remained both in <hi>Praying</hi> and <hi>Preaching,</hi> and of worldly <hi>Authority</hi> and worldly <hi>Greatneſs</hi> in their <hi>Miniſters,</hi> eſpecially in this Kingdom, <hi>Sweden, Denmark</hi> and ſome Parts of <hi>Germany.</hi> God was therefore pleaſed among us, to ſhift from <hi>Veſſel</hi> to <hi>Veſſel:</hi> And the next remove <hi>humbled</hi> the <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> ſo that they were more <hi>Strict</hi> in <hi>Preaching, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout</hi> in <hi>Praying,</hi> and <hi>Zealous</hi> for keeping the <hi>Lords-day,</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſing</hi> of <hi>Children</hi> and <hi>Servants,</hi> and <hi>Repeating</hi> at Home in their <hi>Families</hi> what they had heard in publick.</p>
            <p>But even as theſe grew into <hi>Power,</hi> they were not only for <hi>Whipping</hi> ſome out, but others into the <hi>Temple:</hi> And they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared <hi>Rigid</hi> in their <hi>Spirits,</hi> rather than <hi>Severe</hi> in their <hi>Lives,</hi> and more for a <hi>Party</hi> then for <hi>Piety:</hi> Which brought forth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>People,</hi> that were yet <hi>more retired</hi> and ſelect. They would not communicate <hi>at large,</hi> or in common with others; but formed <hi>Churches</hi> among themſelves of ſuch as could give ſome account of their <hi>Converſion,</hi> at leaſt, of very promiſing experiences of the Work of <hi>God's Grace</hi> upon their Hearts, and under mutual
<pb facs="tcp:51448:14"/> 
               <hi>Agrements</hi> and <hi>Covenants</hi> of fellowſhip they kept together.

            </p>
            <p>They alſo allowed greater liberty to <hi>Prophecy</hi> than thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them; for they admitted any Member to <hi>Speak</hi> or <hi>Pray,</hi> as well as their <hi>Paſtor</hi> (whom they always <hi>Choſe,</hi> and not the <hi>Civil Magiſtrate</hi>).

            <p>Theſe <hi>People</hi> made alſo Profeſſion of <hi>Neglecting,</hi> if not <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing</hi> and <hi>Cenſuring,</hi> not only the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> but uſe of all <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Learning</hi> as to the <hi>Miniſtry;</hi> and all other Qualifications to it beſides the <hi>Helps</hi> and <hi>Gifts</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and thoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and common to <hi>Men;</hi> and for a time they ſeemed like <hi>John</hi> of Old, a <hi>Burning</hi> and a <hi>Shining Light,</hi> to other <hi>Societies.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>People</hi> were called <hi>Seekers</hi> by ſome, and the <hi>Family of Love</hi> by others; becauſe, as they came to the knowledge of one another, they ſometimes met together, not <hi>formally</hi> to <hi>Pray</hi> or <hi>Preach,</hi> at appointed times or <hi>Places,</hi> in their own <hi>Wills,</hi> as in times paſt they were accuſtomed to do; but waited together in <hi>Silence,</hi> and as any thing roſe in any one of their Minds that they thought <hi>Savoured</hi> of a <hi>Divine Spring,</hi> ſo they ſometimes <hi>Spoke.</hi> But ſo it was that ſome of them not keeping in <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility</hi> and in the <hi>Fear of God,</hi> after the Abundance of <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> were <hi>exalted</hi> above <hi>Meaſure,</hi> and for want of ſtaying their Minds in an humble Dependance upon him that opened their <hi>

            </p>
            <p>This <hi>People</hi> obtained the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Ranters</hi> from their extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant <hi>Diſcourſes</hi> and <hi>Practices.</hi> For they interpreted <hi>Chriſt's</hi> fullfilling of the Law for us, to be a diſcharging of us from any <hi>Obligation</hi> and <hi>Duty</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> required, inſtead of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> for ſins paſt, upon <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> and that now it was no <hi>Sin</hi> to do that which before it was a <hi>Sin</hi> to commit; the ſlaviſh Fear of the <hi>Law</hi> being taken off by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and all things good that <hi>Man</hi> did, if he did but do them with the Mind and Perſwaſion <hi>that it was ſo.</hi> Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that divers fell into <hi>Groſs</hi> and <hi>Enormous Practices;</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending in excuſe thereof that they could, without <hi>Evil,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the ſame Act which was <hi>Sin</hi> in another to do; <hi>thereby diſtinguiſhing between the Action and the Evil of it, by the Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Mind and Intention in the doing of it.</hi> Which was to make Sin <hi>Super-abound</hi> by the aboundings of <hi>Grace,</hi> and to turn from the <hi>Grace of God</hi> into Wantonneſs, a ſecurer way of Sinning than before: As if <hi>Chriſt</hi> came not to <hi>take away</hi> Sin, but that we might Sin <hi>more freely</hi> at his Coſt, and with leſs Danger to our ſelves.

            <p>It was about that very ſame time, as you may ſee in the enſuing <hi>Annales,</hi> that the <hi>Eternal, Wiſe,</hi> and <hi>Good God</hi> was pleaſed, in his Infinite <hi>Love,</hi> to Honour and Viſit this benigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

            <p>Two things are to be briefly toucht upon, the <hi>Doctrine</hi> they <hi>Taught,</hi> and the <hi>Example</hi> they lead among all <hi>People.</hi> I have already toucht upon their <hi>Fundamental Principle,</hi> which is as the <hi>Corner ſtone</hi> of their <hi>Fabrick:</hi> And to ſpeak eminently and properly, their <hi>Characteriſtick,</hi> or main diſtinguiſhing <hi>Point</hi> or <hi>Principle,</hi> viz. the <hi>Light of Chriſt within,</hi> as God's Gift for Man's <hi>Salvation.</hi> This I ſay, is as the <hi>Root</hi> of the goodly Tree of <hi>Doctrines</hi> that grew and branched out from it, which I ſhall now mention in their <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Experimental</hi> Order.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, Repentance from dead Works to ſerve the Living God.</hi> Which comprehends three Operations. <hi>Firſt,</hi> a ſight of <hi>Sin. Secondly,</hi> A <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Godly Sorrow</hi> for it. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> An <hi>Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> for the Time to come. This was the <hi>Repentance</hi> they preached and preſſed, and a Natural reſult from the <hi>Principle</hi> they turned all People unto. For of <hi>Light</hi> came <hi>Sight;</hi> and of <hi>Sight</hi> came <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Sorrow;</hi> and of <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Sorrow,</hi> came <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentment</hi> of <hi>Life:</hi> Which <hi>Doctrine</hi> of Repentance leads to <hi>Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;</hi> that is, <hi>Forgiveneſs of the Sins that are paſt through Chriſt the alone Propitiation and the Sanctification or Purgation of the Soul from the defiling Nature and Habits of ſin preſent;</hi> which is juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the compleat <hi>Senſe</hi> of that <hi>Word;</hi> comprehending both juſtification from the <hi>Guilt</hi> of the <hi>Sins</hi> that are paſt, as if they had never been commited, through the <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Mercy of God</hi> in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> and the <hi>Creatures</hi> being made inwardly juſt through the <hi>Cleanſing</hi> and <hi>Sanctifying Power</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of Chriſt revealed in the <hi>Soul;</hi> which is commonly called <hi>Sanctification..</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence ſprang a <hi>Second</hi> Doctrine they were led to declare, as the <hi>Mark of the Price of the High Calling</hi> of all true <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> viz. <hi>Perfection from ſin,</hi> according to the Scriptures of Truth, which teſtifie it to be the <hi>end of Chriſt's coming</hi> and the <hi>Nature of his Kingdom,</hi> and for which his <hi>Spirit</hi> was given. But they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver held a <hi>Perfection</hi> in Wiſdom and Glory in this <hi>Life,</hi> or from <hi>Natural Infirmities</hi> or <hi>Death,</hi> as ſome have with a weak or ill mind, imagined and inſinuated againſt them.</p>
            <p>This they called a <hi>Redeemed State, Regeneration,</hi> or the <hi>New-Birth:</hi> Teaching every where, according to their <hi>Foundation,</hi> that without this <hi>Work</hi> were known, there was no inheriting the <hi>Kingdom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Third,</hi> To an acknowledgment of <hi>Eternal Rewards and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,</hi> as they have good Reaſon; for elſe of all People, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they muſt be the <hi>moſt Miſerable:</hi> Who for about <hi>Forty Years,</hi> have been exceeding great Sufferers for their <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> and in ſome Caſes, treated <hi>worſe</hi> then the <hi>worſt</hi> of Men; yea, as the <hi>Refuge</hi> and <hi>Off-ſcowering</hi> of all things.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:51448:17"/>
            <p>This was the <hi>Purport</hi> of their <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Miniſtry;</hi> which, for the moſt part, is what other <hi>Profeſſors</hi> of Chriſtianity pretend to hold in <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Forms,</hi> but not in the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Godlineſs;</hi> that has been long loſt by Mens departing from that <hi>Principle</hi> and <hi>Seed of Life,</hi> that is in Man and which Man has not regarded, but loſt the <hi>Senſe</hi> of; and in and by which he can only be quickned in his <hi>Mind</hi> to ſerve the <hi>living God</hi> in <hi>Newneſs</hi> of <hi>Life.</hi> For as the <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> was loſt, and the generality lived and <hi>Worſhipped God</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their own Wills, and not after the Will of <hi>God,</hi> nor the mind of Chriſt, which ſtood in the <hi>Works</hi> and <hi>Fruits</hi> of the <hi>Holy Spirit;</hi> ſo that which they preſt, was not <hi>Notion</hi> but <hi>Experience,</hi> no <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality</hi> but <hi>Godlineſs;</hi> as being ſenſible in themſelves, through the <hi>Work</hi> of <hi>God's Righteous Judgments,</hi> that <hi>without Holineſs no Man ſhould ever ſee the Lord</hi> with Comfort.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe <hi>Doctrines,</hi> and out of them, as the larger <hi>Branches,</hi> there ſprang forth ſeveral particular <hi>Doctrines,</hi> that did exemplifie and further explain the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Efficacy</hi> of the General Doctrine before obſerved, in their <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Examples.</hi> As,</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Communion</hi> and <hi>loving one another.</hi> This is a noted <hi>Mark</hi> in the <hi>Mouth</hi> of all ſorts of People concerning them. <hi>They will meet, They will help and ſtick one to another.</hi> Whence it is common to hear ſome ſay, <hi>Look how the Quakers love and take care of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Others leſs Moderate will ſay, <hi>The Quakers love none but themſelves,</hi> and if <hi>loving one another</hi> and having an <hi>Intimate Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> in <hi>Religion,</hi> and conſtant care to meet to <hi>Worſhip God</hi> and help one another, be any Mark of <hi>Primitive Chriſtianity,</hi> they had it, Bleſſed be the Lord, in an ample manner.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>To love Enemies:</hi> This they both <hi>Taught</hi> and <hi>Practiſed:</hi> For they did not only refuſe to be revenged for <hi>Injuries</hi> done them, and condemned it as of an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nchriſtian Spirit,</hi> but they did freely <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give,</hi> yea, <hi>Help</hi> and <hi>Relieve</hi> thoſe that had been <hi>Cruel</hi> to them, when it was in their <hi>Power</hi> to have been even with them; of which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and ſingular <hi>Inſtances</hi> might be given: Endeavouring, through <hi>Patience,</hi> to overcome all <hi>Injuſtice</hi> and <hi>Oppreſſion,</hi> and Preaching this <hi>Doctrine</hi> as <hi>Chriſtian</hi> for others to follow.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>The Sufficiency of Truth ſpeaking,</hi> according to Chriſt's own form of Words, of <hi>Yea, Yea,</hi> and <hi>Nay, Nay,</hi> among Chriſtians without <hi>Swearing,</hi> both from Chriſt's expreſs Prohibition <hi>to Swear at all.</hi> Mat. 5. And for that they being under the <hi>Tye and Bond of Truth in themſelves,</hi> there was both no Neceſſity for an <hi>Oath,</hi> and it would be a <hi>Reproach</hi> to their Chriſtian Veracity to <hi>Aſſure</hi> their <hi>Truth</hi> by ſuch an Extraordinary way of Speaking: But offering at the ſame time, to be punniſht to the full, for falſe <hi>Speaking,</hi> as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for <hi>Perjury,</hi> if ever guilty of it; and hereby they exclude, with all <hi>True,</hi> all <hi>Falſe</hi> and <hi>Prophane Swearing;</hi> for which the <hi>Land</hi> did and doth <hi>Mourn,</hi> and the great God was and is not a little offended with it.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb facs="tcp:51448:18"/>IV. <hi>Not Fighting</hi> but <hi>Suffering,</hi> is another Teſtimony peculiar to this People: They affirm that Chriſtianity teacheth People <hi>To beat their Swords into Plough Shears, and their Spears into Pruning Hooks, and to learn War no more, that ſo the Wolf may lie down with the Lamb, and the Lyon with the Calf, and nothing that deſtroys be entertained in the Hearts of People;</hi> exhorting them to employ their <hi>Zeal</hi> againſt <hi>Sin,</hi> and turn their <hi>Anger</hi> againſt <hi>Satan,</hi> and no longer <hi>War</hi> one againſt another; becauſe, all <hi>Wars</hi> and <hi>Fightings</hi> come of Mens own <hi>Hearts Luſts,</hi> according to the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> and not of the <hi>Meek Spirit</hi> of Chriſt Jeſus who is Captain of <hi>another Warfare,</hi> and which is carried on with <hi>other Weapons.</hi> Thus, as <hi>Truth</hi> ſpeaking ſucceeded Swearing, ſo <hi>Faith and Truth ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Fighting,</hi> in the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Practiſe</hi> of this <hi>People.</hi> Nor ought they for this to be Obnoxious to <hi>Civil Government,</hi> ſince if they cannot Fight for it, neither <hi>can they Fight againſt it;</hi> which is no mean ſecurity to the State: Nor is it reaſonable that People ſhould be blamed for not doing more for others than they can do for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> ſet aſide, if the <hi>Coſts</hi> and <hi>Fruits</hi> of War were well conſidered, <hi>Peace,</hi> with its <hi>Inconveniencies,</hi> is generally <hi>Preferable.</hi> But though they were not for <hi>Fighting,</hi> they were for <hi>ſubmitting</hi> to <hi>Government;</hi> and that, <hi>not only for Fear, but for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience Sake,</hi> where <hi>Government</hi> doth not <hi>interfere</hi> with <hi>Conſcience:</hi> Believing it to be an <hi>Ordinance of God,</hi> and where it is juſtly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, a great <hi>Benefit</hi> to Minkind: Tho' it has been their <hi>Lot,</hi> through blind <hi>Zeal</hi> in ſome, and <hi>Intereſt</hi> in others, to have felt the <hi>Strokes</hi> of it with greater <hi>Weight</hi> and <hi>Rigour</hi> than any other <hi>Perſwaſion</hi> in this Age; whilſt they, of all others (Religion ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide) have given the <hi>Civil Magiſtrate</hi> the <hi>leaſt occaſion of Trouble</hi> in the Diſcharge of his Office.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Another part of the <hi>Character</hi> of this People is, <hi>They refuſe to pay Tythes,</hi> or <hi>Maintenance to a National Miniſtry,</hi> and that for two Reaſons; The one is, that they believe all <hi>compelled Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi> even to <hi>Goſpel Miniſters,</hi> to be <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful,</hi> becauſe <hi>expreſly contrary</hi> to Chriſt's Command, who ſaid, <hi>Freely you have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, freely give:</hi> At leaſt, that the Maintenance of <hi>Goſpel Miniſters</hi> ſhould be <hi>free</hi> and not <hi>forced.</hi> The other Reaſon of their <hi>Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal</hi> is, Becauſe thoſe <hi>Miniſters</hi> are not <hi>Goſpel ones,</hi> in that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is not their <hi>Foundation,</hi> but <hi>Humane Arts and Parts:</hi> So that it is not matter of <hi>Humor</hi> or <hi>Sullenneſs,</hi> but <hi>pure Conſcience</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, that they cannot help to ſupport <hi>National Miniſters</hi> where they dwell, which are but too much and too viſibly become ways of <hi>Worldly Advantage</hi> and <hi>Preferment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">VI. <hi>Not to reſpect Perſons,</hi> was another of their <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Practices,</hi> for which they were <hi>often Buffeted</hi> and <hi>Abuſed.</hi> They Affirmed it to be ſinful to give <hi>Flattering Titles,</hi> or to uſe <hi>Vain Geſtures</hi> and <hi>Complements</hi> of <hi>Reſpect;</hi> tho' to <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> they ever made a <hi>Difference,</hi> but after their <hi>Plain</hi> and <hi>Homely Manner,</hi> yet ſincere and ſubſtantial way; well remembering the
<pb facs="tcp:51448:18"/> Example of <hi>Mordecai</hi> and <hi>Elihu,</hi> but more eſpecially the <hi>Command</hi> of their Lord and Maſter <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who forbad his Followers to call Men <hi>Rabby,</hi> which implies <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Maſter,</hi> alſo the <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhionable Greetings</hi> and <hi>Salutations</hi> of thoſe Times; that ſo <hi>Self-love</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi> to which the proud Mind of Man is incident, in his fallen Eſtate, might not be Indulged but Rebuked.</p>
            <p>They alſo uſed the Plain <hi>Language</hi> of <hi>Thou</hi> and <hi>Thee</hi> to a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Perſon, whatever was his <hi>Degree</hi> among Men. And indeed the <hi>Wiſdom of God</hi> was much ſeen, in bringing forth this People in ſo Plain an <hi>Appearance;</hi> for it was a <hi>Cloſe</hi> and <hi>Diſtinguiſhing Teſt</hi> upon the Spirit of thoſe they came among; ſhewing their Inſides and what predominated, notwithſtanding their High and Great Profeſſion of <hi>Religion.</hi> This, among the reſt, ſounded ſo harſh to many of them, and they took it ſo ill, that they would ſay, <hi>Thou me, Thou my Dog: If thou thoueſt me, I'le thou thy Teeth down thy Throat,</hi> forgetting the <hi>Language</hi> they uſe to God in their own <hi>Prayers,</hi> and the common Stile of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and that it is an abſolute and eſſential <hi>Propriety</hi> of <hi>Speech:</hi> And what good had their <hi>Religion</hi> done them, who were ſo ſenſibly toucht with <hi>Indignation</hi> for the uſe of this <hi>Plain, Honeſt,</hi> and <hi>True Speech?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">VI. They recommended <hi>Silence</hi> by their Example, having very few words upon all Occaſions: They were <hi>at a Word</hi> in <hi>Dealing;</hi> nor could their <hi>Cuſtomers</hi> many Words tempt them from it; having more regard for <hi>Truth</hi> than <hi>Cuſtom,</hi> to Example then <hi>Gain,</hi> they ſought <hi>Solitude;</hi> but when in <hi>Company,</hi> they would neither uſe nor willingly hear <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nneceſſary</hi> as well as <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful Diſcourſes;</hi> whereby they preſerved their Minds pure and undiſturbed from unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Thoughts</hi> and <hi>Diverſions:</hi> Nor could they humour the Cuſtom of <hi>Good Night, Good Morrow, God Speed;</hi> for they knew the <hi>Night</hi> was <hi>Good,</hi> and the <hi>Day</hi> was <hi>Good,</hi> without wiſhing of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and that in the other Expreſſion, the <hi>Holy Name</hi> of <hi>God</hi> was too lightly and unthinkingly uſed, and therefore taken in <hi>Vain.</hi> Beſides, they were Words and Wiſhes of <hi>Courſe,</hi> and are uſually as little meant, as are <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Service</hi> in the Cuſtom of <hi>Cap</hi> and <hi>Knee;</hi> and ſuperfluity in thoſe as well as in other things was Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſom to them; and therefore They did not only decline to uſe them, but found themſelves often preſt to reprove the Practice.</p>
            <p>For the ſame reaſon they forbore <hi>Drinking to People, or Pledging of them,</hi> as the manner of the World is: A Practice that is not only Unneceſſary, but they thought <hi>Evil</hi> in the <hi>Tendencies</hi> of it; being a <hi>Provocation</hi> to <hi>Drinking</hi> more than did <hi>People Good,</hi> as well as that it was in it ſelf <hi>Vain</hi> and <hi>Heatheniſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">VII. Their way of <hi>Marriage</hi> is peculiar to them; and is a <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing</hi> Practice from all other Societies profeſſing <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> They ſay that <hi>Marriage</hi> is an <hi>Ordinance of God, and that God only can rightly join Man and Woman in Marriage.</hi> Therefore they uſe
<pb facs="tcp:51448:19"/> neither <hi>Prieſt</hi> nor <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> but the <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Woman</hi> concern'd take each other as <hi>Husband</hi> and <hi>Wife</hi> in the preſence of divers Credible Witneſſes, <hi>promiſing unto each other with God's Aſſiſtance, to be Loving and Faithful in that Relation till Death ſhall ſeparate them.</hi> But, antecedent to all this, They firſt preſent themſelves to the <hi>Monthly Meeting</hi> for the Affairs of the <hi>Church,</hi> where they reſide, There declaring their <hi>Intentions</hi> to take one another as <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Wife,</hi> if the ſaid Meeting have nothing material to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject againſt it. They are conſtantly askt the neceſſary <hi>Queſtions,</hi> as in Caſe of <hi>Parents,</hi> or <hi>Guardians</hi> if they have acquainted them with their <hi>Intention,</hi> and have their <hi>Conſent,</hi> &amp;c. The Method of the <hi>Meeting</hi> is to take a Minute thereof, and to appoint <hi>Proper Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> to enquire of their <hi>Converſation</hi> and <hi>Clearneſs</hi> from all others, and whether they have diſcharged their <hi>Duty</hi> to their <hi>Parents</hi> or <hi>Guardians;</hi> and make report thereof the next <hi>Monthly Meeting;</hi> where the ſame Parties are deſired to give their Attendance. In caſe it appears they proceeded Orderly, the Meeting paſſes their <hi>Propoſal,</hi> and ſo <hi>Records</hi> it in their Meeting Book; and in Caſe the Woman be a <hi>Widow</hi> and hath Children, due care is there taken, that Proviſion alſo be made by her for the <hi>Orphans</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſaid <hi>Marriage;</hi> adviſing the Parties concerned to appoint a convenient Time and place, and to give fitting Notice to their <hi>Relations,</hi> and ſuch <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Neighbours,</hi> as they deſire ſhould be the Witneſſes of their <hi>Marriage:</hi> Where they take one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Hand, and by Name promiſing Reciprocally af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Manner before expreſſed. Of all which <hi>Proceedings,</hi> a <hi>Narative,</hi> in a way of <hi>Certificate,</hi> is made, to which the ſaid Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties firſt ſet their Hands, thereby making it their <hi>Act</hi> and <hi>Deed;</hi> and then divers of the <hi>Relations, Spectators</hi> and <hi>Auditors</hi> ſet their Names as <hi>Witneſſes</hi> of what they Said and Signed. Which <hi>Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate,</hi> is afterward <hi>Regiſtred</hi> in the <hi>Record</hi> belonging to the <hi>Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> where the Marriage is Solemnized. Which Regular Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod has been, as it deſerves, adjudged in <hi>Courts of Law a good Marriage,</hi> where it has been Diſputed and Conteſted, for want of the accuſtomed Formality of <hi>Prieſt</hi> and <hi>Ring,</hi> &amp;c. which <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies</hi> they have Refuſed, not out of <hi>Humour,</hi> but <hi>Conſcience</hi> reaſonably grounded, in as much as no Scripture Example tells us, that the <hi>Prieſt</hi> had any other part of <hi>Old Time,</hi> than that of a <hi>Witneſs</hi> among the reſt, before whom the <hi>Jews</hi> uſed to take one another: And therefore this People look upon it as an <hi>Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> to advance the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Profits</hi> of the <hi>Clergy.</hi> And for the uſe of the <hi>Ring,</hi> it is enough to ſay that it was an <hi>Heathen</hi> and vain <hi>Cuſtom.</hi> and never in Practice among the People of God, <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Primitive Chriſtans.</hi> The words of the Uſual form, as <hi>With my Body I thee Worſhip,</hi> &amp;c. are hardly defenſible: In ſhort, they are more Careful, Exact and Regular than any Form now uſed, and it is Free of the inconveniencies other Methods are attended with. Their <hi>Care</hi> and <hi>Checks</hi> being ſo many, and ſuch, as no Clandeſtine Marriages can be perform'd among them.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb facs="tcp:51448:19"/>VIII. It may not be unfit to ſay ſomething here of their <hi>Births</hi> and <hi>Burials,</hi> which make up ſo much of the <hi>Pomp</hi> and <hi>Solemnity</hi> of too many called <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> For <hi>Births,</hi> the Parents <hi>Name</hi> their own Children, which is uſually ſome days after they are <hi>Born,</hi> in the preſence of the <hi>Midwife</hi> (if ſhe can be there) and thoſe that were at the <hi>Birth,</hi> &amp;c. who afterward ſign a <hi>Certificate,</hi> for that purpoſe prepared, of the <hi>Birth</hi> and <hi>Name</hi> of the Child, or Children, which is Recorded in a proper Book, in the <hi>Monthly Meeting,</hi> to which the <hi>Parents</hi> belong; avoiding the accuſtomed Cerimonies and Feaſtivals.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. Their <hi>Burials</hi> are performed with the ſame <hi>Simplicity.</hi> If the <hi>Corps</hi> of the Deceaſed be near any publick <hi>Meeting Place,</hi> it is uſually carried thither, for the more convenient <hi>Reception</hi> of thoſe that Accompany it to the <hi>Ground</hi> they <hi>Bury</hi> in, and it ſo falls out ſometimes, that while the <hi>Meeting</hi> is gathering for the <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,</hi> ſome or other have a <hi>Word of Exhortation,</hi> for the ſake of the People there met together: After which, the <hi>Body</hi> is borne away by the Young Men, or thoſe that are of their Neighbourhood, or that were moſt of the Intimacy of the <hi>Deceaſed Party:</hi> The Corps being in a plain <hi>Coffin,</hi> without any <hi>Covering</hi> or <hi>Furniture</hi> upon it. At the <hi>Ground,</hi> they pauſe ſome time before they put the <hi>Body</hi> into its <hi>Grave,</hi> that if any one there ſhould have any thing upon them to exhort the <hi>People,</hi> they may not be diſſappointed, and that the <hi>Relations</hi> may the more <hi>Retiredly</hi> and <hi>Solemnly</hi> take their laſt leave of the <hi>Corps</hi> of their departed <hi>Kindred,</hi> and the <hi>Spectators</hi> have a Senſe of <hi>Mortality,</hi> by the occaſion then given them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon their own <hi>Latter End.</hi> Otherways, they have no ſet <hi>Rites</hi> or <hi>Ceremonies</hi> on thoſe Occaſions; neither do the <hi>Kindred</hi> of the <hi>Deceaſed</hi> ever wear <hi>Mourning;</hi> they looking upon it as a <hi>Wordly Ceremony</hi> and piece of <hi>Pomp,</hi> and that what <hi>Mourning</hi> is fit for a Chriſtian to have at the Departure of a beloved <hi>Relation</hi> or <hi>Friend,</hi> ſhould be worn in the <hi>Mind</hi> which is only ſenſible of the <hi>Loſs,</hi> and the Love they had to them, and Remembrance of them, to be outwardly expreſt by a reſpect to their Advice, and care of thoſe they have left behind them, and their Love of that they Loved. Which <hi>Conduct</hi> of theirs, though unmodiſh or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſhionable, leaves nothing of the Subſtance of things neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or undone; and as they aim at no more, ſo that ſimplicity of <hi>Life</hi> is what they obſerve with great Satisfaction, though it ſometimes happens not to be without the <hi>Mockeries</hi> of the vain World they live in.</p>
            <p>Theſe things gave them a <hi>Rough</hi> and <hi>Diſagreeable</hi> Appearance with the Generality; who thought them <hi>Turners of the World upſide down,</hi> as indeed, in ſome Senſe they were; but in no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than that wherein <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo charged, <hi>viz. To bring things back into their Primitive and right Order again.</hi> For theſe and ſuch like <hi>Practices</hi> of theirs were not the <hi>Reſult</hi> of <hi>Humour,</hi> as ſome have fancied, but a Fruit of <hi>Inward Senſe,</hi> which God,
<pb facs="tcp:51448:20"/> through his <hi>Fear,</hi> had begotten in them. They did not conſider how to contradict the <hi>World,</hi> or diſtinguiſh themſelves; being none of their Buſineſs, as it was not their <hi>Intereſt,</hi> no, it was not the Reſult of <hi>Conſultation,</hi> or a framed deſign to declare or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend <hi>Schiſm</hi> or <hi>Novelty.</hi> But God having given them a ſight of themſelves, they ſaw the <hi>whole World</hi> in the ſame <hi>Glaſs</hi> of <hi>Truth;</hi> and ſenſibly diſcerned the <hi>Affections</hi> and <hi>Paſſions</hi> of Men, and the <hi>Riſe</hi> and <hi>Tendency</hi> of <hi>Things.</hi> What gratified the <hi>Luſt of the Fleſh, the Luſt of the Eye and the Pride of Life which are not of the Father, but of the World;</hi> and from thence Sprang in that <hi>Night</hi> of <hi>Darkneſs</hi> and <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> which hath been over People, through their Degeneration from the <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of God, theſe and many other vain Cuſtoms; which are ſeen by the Heavenly day of Chriſt which dawns in the Soul, to be, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wrong in their <hi>Original,</hi> or, by <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Abuſe,</hi> Hurtful in their <hi>Practice.</hi> And though theſe things ſeemed <hi>Trivial</hi> to ſome, and rendered this People <hi>Stingy</hi> and conceited in ſuch Perſons <hi>Opinions;</hi> there was and is more in them than they were aware of. It was not very eaſie to our <hi>Primitive Friends,</hi> to make themſelves <hi>Sights</hi> and <hi>Spectacles,</hi> and the <hi>Scorn</hi> and <hi>Deriſion</hi> of the World; which they eaſily foreſaw muſt be the Conſequence of ſo <hi>

               <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and <hi>Crucified</hi> him and <hi>Whipt</hi> and <hi>Impriſoned</hi> his Servants; ſo haſt thou, <hi>O Land,</hi> Crucified to thy ſelf afreſh the <hi>Lord of Life and Glory,</hi> and done <hi>diſpite</hi> to his Spirit of Grace; <hi>ſlighting</hi> the Fatherly <hi>Viſitation,</hi> and <hi>perſecuting</hi> the bleſſed Diſpenſers of it by thy <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Magiſtrates;</hi> though they have Early and Late <hi>pleaded</hi> with thee in the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of the Lord; in <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Meekneſs,</hi> that thou mighteſt know the Lord and ſerve him, and become the <hi>Glory</hi> of all Lands.</p>
            <p>But thou haſt <hi>Evilly</hi> entreated and requited them. Thou haſt ſet at naught all their <hi>Counſel,</hi> and would have none of their <hi>Reproof,</hi> as thou ſhouldeſt have done. Their appearance was too <hi>Straight,</hi> and their qualifications were to <hi>Mean</hi> for thee to receive them; who like the <hi>Jews of Old,</hi> that cryed, <hi>Is not this the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters Son, and are not his Brethren among us; which of the Scribes, of the Learned (the Orthodox) believe in him?</hi> Propheſying their <hi>fall</hi> in a year or two, and making and executing of ſevere <hi>Laws</hi> to bring it to paſs; by endeavouring to terrifie them out of their <hi>Holy way,</hi> or diſtroying them for abiding <hi>Faithful</hi> to it. But thou haſt ſeen how many <hi>Governments</hi> that riſe againſt them, and determined their <hi>Downfal,</hi> have been <hi>overturned</hi> and <hi>extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed,</hi> and that they are <hi>ſtill</hi> preſerved, and become a <hi>great</hi> and a conſiderable <hi>People,</hi> among the Middle ſort of thy nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Inhabitants. And notwithſtanding the many difficulties <hi>without</hi> and <hi>within,</hi> which they have Laboured <hi>under,</hi> ſince the Lord God Eternal firſt gathered them, they are an <hi>encreaſing Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> the Lord ſtill adding unto them, in divers <hi>Parts,</hi> ſuch as ſhall be ſaved, if they perſevere to the End. And to thee; were they and are they lifted up as a <hi>Standard,</hi> and as a <hi>City</hi> ſet upon a <hi>Hill,</hi> and to the Nations round about thee, that in <hi>their Light,</hi> thou may'ſt come to ſee <hi>Light,</hi> even in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> the <hi>Light of the World;</hi> and therefore thy <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> too, if thou wouldſt but turn from thy many evil ways, and receive and obey it. For in the <hi>Light of the Lamb, muſt the Nations of them that are ſaved walk,</hi> as the Scriptures Teſtify.</p>
            <p>Remember, O Nation of great <hi>Profeſſion!</hi> How the Lord has waited upon thee ſince the Days of <hi>Reformation,</hi> and the many <hi>Mercies</hi> and <hi>Judgments</hi> with which he has pleaded with Thee; and <hi>awake</hi> and <hi>ariſe</hi> out of thy <hi>deep Sleep,</hi> and yet hear (his <hi>Word</hi> in thy <hi>Heart</hi>) that thou may'ſt live.</p>
            <p>Let not this thy day of <hi>Viſitation</hi> paſs over thy Head, nor neglect thou ſo great <hi>Salvation</hi> as is this which is come to thy Houſe, Oh <hi>England!</hi> For why ſhould'ſt thou die, Oh <hi>Land</hi> that God deſires to Bleſs? Be aſſured it is he that has been in the mid'ſt of this <hi>People,</hi> in the mid'ſt of thee; and no Deluſion, as thy miſtaken <hi>Teachers</hi> have made thee believe.

               <pb facs="tcp:51448:21"/>I. They were <hi>changed</hi> Men themſelves before they went about to <hi>change</hi> others. Their <hi>Hearts</hi> were rent as well as their <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi> and they knew the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Work of God</hi> upon them. And this was ſeen by the great Alteration it made, and their ſtricter Courſe of Life, and more Godly Converſation, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately followed upon it.</p>
            <p n="2">II. They went not forth or <hi>Preached</hi> in their own <hi>Time</hi> or <hi>Will,</hi> but in the <hi>Will of God,</hi> and Spoke not their own <hi>ſtuddied Matter,</hi> but as they were opened and moved of his <hi>Spirit,</hi> with which they were well acquainted in their own Converſion; which cannot be expreſt to <hi>Carnal Men</hi> ſo as to give them any intelligible account; for to ſuch it is as <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid, <hi>like the blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Wind, which no Man knows whence it cometh, or whether it goeth:</hi> Yet this Proof and Seal went along with their Miniſtry, that <hi>many were turned</hi> from their <hi>Life-leſs</hi> Profeſſions, and the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil of their Ways,</hi> to the knowledge of <hi>God,</hi> and an <hi>Holy Life,</hi> as thouſands can witneſs. And as they Freely received what they had to ſay from the Lord, ſo they Freely adminiſtred it to others.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The <hi>Bent</hi> and <hi>Streſs</hi> of their <hi>Miniſtry</hi> was <hi>Converſion</hi> to God, <hi>Regeneration</hi> and <hi>Holineſs;</hi> not Schemes of <hi>Doctrines</hi> and Verbal <hi>Creeds,</hi> or new <hi>Forms of Worſhip;</hi> but a leaving off in Religion the <hi>Superfluous,</hi> and reducing the <hi>Ceremonious</hi> and <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal</hi> part, and preſſing earneſtly the <hi>Subſtantial,</hi> the <hi>Neceſſary</hi> and <hi>Proffitable</hi> part; as all upon a ſerious Reflection muſt and do accknowledge.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. They directed <hi>People</hi> to a <hi>Principle,</hi> by which all that they aſſerted, <hi>Preached</hi> and <hi>Exhorted</hi> others to, might be wrought in them and known, through <hi>Experience,</hi> to them to be true; which is a high and diſtinguiſhing <hi>Mark</hi> of the <hi>Truth</hi> of their <hi>Miniſtry;</hi> both that they <hi>knew</hi> what they ſaid, and were not afraid of coming to the <hi>Teſt.</hi> For as they were bold from <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,</hi> ſo they required <hi>Conformity</hi> upon no <hi>Humane Authority,</hi> but upon <hi>Conviction,</hi> and the <hi>Conviction</hi> of this <hi>Principle,</hi> which they aſſerted was in them that they <hi>Preached unto, and unto that directed them,</hi> that they might <hi>examine</hi> and <hi>prove</hi> the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of thoſe things which they had affirmed of it, and its Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation and Work in Man. And this is more than the many <hi>Miniſtries</hi> in the World pretend to. They declare of <hi>Religion,</hi> ſay many things true; in words <hi>of God, Chriſt, and the Spirit; of Holineſs and Heaven; that all Men ſhould Repent and mend their Lives, or they will go to Hell,</hi> &amp;c. but which of them all pretend to ſpeak of their own <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Experience?</hi> Or ever directed Men to a Divine Principle, or <hi>Agent,</hi> placed of God <hi>in Man,</hi> to help him; and how to know it, and <hi>wait</hi> to feel its <hi>Power</hi> to work that good and accceptable <hi>Will of God</hi> in them.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:51448:22"/>
            <p>Some of them indeed have <hi>Spoke</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and the <hi>Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi> of it to <hi>Sanctification,</hi> and <hi>Performance</hi> of <hi>Worſhip</hi> to God; but <hi>where</hi> and <hi>how</hi> to find it and wait in it to perform, was yet as a Miſtery reſerved for <hi>this further degree of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</hi> So that this People did not only in words, more than equally preſs <hi>Repentance, Converſion</hi> and <hi>Holineſs,</hi> but did it <hi>knowingly</hi> and <hi>experimentally;</hi> and directed thoſe to whom they preach'd, to a ſufficient <hi>Principle,</hi> and told them where it is, and by what <hi>Tokens</hi> they might know it, and which way they might experience the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Efficacy</hi> of it to their <hi>Soul's Happineſs.</hi> Which is more then <hi>Theory</hi> and <hi>Speculations,</hi> upon which moſt other <hi>Miniſtries</hi> depend; for here is <hi>certainly,</hi> a <hi>bottom</hi> upon which Man may boldly appear before God in the great Day of Account.</p>
            <p n="5">V. They reached to the <hi>Inward State</hi> and <hi>Condition</hi> of <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> which is an Evidence of the <hi>Virtue</hi> of their <hi>Principle,</hi> and of their <hi>Miniſtring</hi> from it, and not their own <hi>Imaginations, Gloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> or <hi>Comments</hi> upon <hi>Scripture.</hi> For nothing reaches the <hi>Heart,</hi> but what is <hi>from the Heart,</hi> or pierces the <hi>Conſcience,</hi> but what comes from a living <hi>Conſcience.</hi> Inſomuch as it hath often happened, where <hi>People</hi> have under Secrecy revealed their <hi>State</hi> or <hi>Condition</hi> to ſome choice <hi>Friends,</hi> for <hi>Advice</hi> or <hi>Eaſe,</hi> they have been ſo particularly directed in the Miniſtry of this People, that they have challenged their Friends with diſcovering their <hi>Secrets,</hi> and telling the Preachers their <hi>Caſes.</hi> Yea, the very <hi>Thoughts</hi> and <hi>Purpoſes</hi> of the hearts of many have been ſo plainly detected; that they have (like <hi>Nathaniel</hi>) cryed out of this inward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Chriſt, <hi>Thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of</hi> Iſrael. And thoſe that have embraced this <hi>Divine Principle,</hi> have found this Mark of its <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Divinity</hi> (that the Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> did of Chriſt when in the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> to be the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi>) viz. <hi>It had told them all that ever they did;</hi> ſhowed them their <hi>inſides,</hi> the <hi>moſt inward</hi> ſecrets of their Hearts, and laid <hi>Judgment</hi> to the <hi>Line,</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> to the <hi>Plummet;</hi> of which <hi>Thouſands</hi> can, at this day give in their Witneſs. So that nothing has been affirmed by this People, of the Power and Virtue of this <hi>Heavenly Principle,</hi> that ſuch as have turned to it have not found true, and more; and that one half had not been told to them of what they have ſeen of the <hi>Power, Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Wiſdom, Mercy</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of God herein.</p>
            <p n="6">VI.

            <p>They could have no deſign to themſelves in this Work, thus to expoſe themſelves to <hi>Scorn</hi> and <hi>Abuſe;</hi> to ſpend and be ſpent: Leaving <hi>Wife</hi> and <hi>Children, Houſe</hi> and <hi>Land,</hi> and all that can be accounted dear to Men, <hi>with their lives in their Hands,</hi> being daily in <hi>Jeopardy,</hi> to declare this <hi>Primitive Meſſage,</hi> 1 Jo. 1.5. revived in their Spirits, by the good Spirit and Power of God. <hi>viz.

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt</hi> Charge of <hi>Error,</hi> than by the falſe <hi>Imputation</hi> of <hi>Diſorder:</hi> Which <hi>Calumny</hi> indeed has not failed to follow all the true ſteps that were ever made to <hi>Reformation,</hi> and under which Reproach none ſuffered more than the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians</hi> themſelves, that were the Honour of <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,</hi> and the great Lights and Examples of their own and ſucceeding Ages.</p>
            <p>This People encreaſing daily both in Town and Country, an Holy Care fell upon ſome of the <hi>Elders</hi> among them, for the Benefit and Service of the Church. And the firſt Buſineſs in their View, after the Example of the <hi>Primitive Saints,</hi> was the Exerciſe of <hi>Charity,</hi> to ſupply the Neceſſities of the <hi>Poor,</hi> and anſwer the like Occaſions: Wherefore <hi>Collections</hi> were early and liberally made for that, and divers other Services in the Church, and intruſted with Faithful Men, fearing God, and of good Report, who were not weary in well-doing; adding often of their own, in large Proportions, which they never brought to account, or deſired ſhould be known, much leſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to them, that none might want, nor any Service be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded or diſappointed.</p>
            <p>They were alſo very careful, that every one that belonged to them, anſwered their Profeſſion in their Behaviour among Men, upon all Occaſions; that they lived Peaceably, and were in all things good Examples. They found themſelves engaged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord their Sufferings and Services; and in caſe of Marriage, which they could not perform in the uſual Methods of the Nation, but among themſelves; they took care that all things were clear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Parties and all others, and it was then rare that any one entertain'd ſuch Inclination to a Perſon on that account, till he or ſhe had communicated it ſecretly to ſome very Weighty and Eminent Friends among them, that they might have a ſenſe of the Matter; looking to the Council and Unity of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, as of great Moment to them. But becauſe the Charge of the Poor, the Number of Orphans, Marriages, Sufferings and other Matters multiplied, and that it was good that the
<pb facs="tcp:51448:23"/> Churches were in ſome way and Method, of proceeding in ſuch Affairs among them, to the end they might the better correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pond upon occaſion, where a Member of one Meeting, might have to do with one of another: It pleaſed the Lord in his Wiſdom and Goodneſs, to open the Underſtanding of the firſt Inſtrument of this Diſpenſation of Life, about a Good and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly way of Proceeding; and he felt an Holy Concern to viſit the Churches in Perſon throughout this Nation, to begin and eſtabliſh it among them; and by his Epiſtles the like was done in other Nations and Provinces abroad; which he alſo after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Viſited, and helped in that Service, as ſhall be obſerved when I come to ſpeak of him.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Care, Conduct</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> I have been ſpeaking of, and which is now practiſed among this People, is as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
            <p n="3">III. This Godly Elder, in every County where he travelled, exhorted them, that ſome out of every Meeting of Worſhip, ſhould meet together once in the Month, to confer about the Wants and Occaſions of the Church. And as the Caſe requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, ſo thoſe Monthly Meetings were fewer or more in number in every reſpective County; Four or Six Meetings of Worſhip, uſually making one <hi>Monthly Meeting</hi> of Buſineſs. And according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Brethren</hi> met him from place to place, and began the ſaid <hi>Meetings,</hi> viz. <hi>For the Poor, Orphans orderly Walking, Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity to their Profeſſion, Births, Marriages, Burials, Sufferings</hi> &amp;c. And that theſe <hi>Monthly</hi> Meetings ſhould, in each County make up one <hi>Quarterly</hi> Meeting, where the moſt <hi>Zealous</hi> and <hi>Eminent Friends</hi> of the County ſhould aſſemble to <hi>Communicate, Adviſe</hi> and <hi>Help</hi> one another, eſpecially when any <hi>Buſineſs</hi> ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed difficult, or a <hi>Monthly</hi> Meeting was tender of determining a Matter.</p>
            <p>Alſo theſe <hi>Quarterly</hi> Meetings ſhould digeſt the Reports of the <hi>Monthly</hi> Meetings, and prepare one for the <hi>County,</hi> againſt the <hi>Yearly</hi> Meeting; in which the <hi>Quarterly</hi> Meetings reſolve, which is held Yearly in <hi>London;</hi> where the Churches in this <hi>Nation,</hi> and other <hi>Nations,</hi> and <hi>Provinces</hi> Meet, by choſen Members of their Reſpective Counties, both mutually to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate their <hi>Church Affairs,</hi> and to adviſe and be adviſed in any depending Caſe to <hi>Edification.</hi> Alſo to provide a requiſite Stock, for the diſcharge of general <hi>Expences</hi> for general <hi>Services</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> not needful to be here particularized.</p>
            <p>At theſe Meetings any of the <hi>Members</hi> of the <hi>Churches</hi> may come if they pleaſe, and ſpeak their <hi>Minds</hi> freely, in the <hi>Fear of God,</hi> to any matter; but the Mind of each Meeting therein repreſented is chiefly underſtood, as to perticuler <hi>Caſes,</hi> in the Senſe delivered by the Perſons deputed or choſen for that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:51448:24"/>
            <p>During their Yearly <hi>Meeting,</hi> to which their other <hi>Meetings</hi> referr in their Order and Reſolve themſelves; care is taken by a Select Number, for that ſervice choſen by the <hi>General Aſſembly,</hi> to draw up the Minutes of the ſaid Meeting, upon the ſeveral matters that have been under Conſideration therein, to the end that the Reſpective <hi>Quarterly</hi> and <hi>Monthly Meetings</hi> may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of all Proceedings, together with a general <hi>Exhortation</hi> to <hi>Holineſs, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> and <hi>Charity:</hi> Of all which Proceedings in <hi>Yearly, Quarterly</hi> and <hi>Monthly Meetings,</hi> due <hi>Record</hi> is kept by ſome One appointed for that Service, or that hath voluntarily undertaken it. Theſe Meetings are opened, and uſually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in their <hi>Solemn</hi> waiting upon God, who is ſometimes graciouſly pleaſed to anſwer them with as ſignal Evidences of his <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Preſence,</hi> as in any other their Meetings of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
            <p>It is further to be Noted, that in theſe <hi>Solemn Aſſemblies,</hi> for the Church's Service, there is no one preſides among them after the manner of the <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> of other People; Chriſt only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their <hi>Preſident,</hi> as he is pleaſed to appear in <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> in any one or more of them, to whom, whatever be their <hi>Capacity</hi> or <hi>Degree,</hi> the reſt adhere with a <hi>Firm <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> not of <hi>Authority</hi> but <hi>Conviction,</hi> which is the <hi>Divine Authority</hi> and way of Chriſt's <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> in his <hi>People:</hi> Making good his bleſſed Promiſe, <hi>That he would be in the Midſt of his, where and whenever they were met together in his Name, even to the End of the World.</hi> So be it.</p>
            <p>Now it may be expected, I ſhould here ſet down what ſort of Authority is exerciſed by this <hi>People,</hi> upon ſuch Members of their Society, as correſpond not in their <hi>Lives</hi> with their <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,</hi> and that are <hi>Refractory</hi> to this good and wholeſom Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſettled among them; and the rather becauſe they have not wanted their Reproach and Suffering from ſome <hi>Tongues,</hi> upon this occaſion in a plentiful manner.</p>
            <p>The Power they exerciſe is ſuch as Chriſt has given to his own <hi>People,</hi> to the End of the World, in the Perſons of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, <hi>viz. To Overſee, Exhort, Reprove,</hi> and after long <hi>Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>Waiting</hi> upon the <hi>Diſobedient</hi> and <hi>Refractory, to diſown them, as any more of their Communion, or that they will any longer ſtand Charged in the Sight and Judgment of God or Men, with their Converſation or Behaviour as one of them, untill they Repent.</hi> The ſubject matter about which this <hi>Authority,</hi> in any of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going <hi>Branches</hi> of it, is Exerciſed; is <hi>Firſt,</hi> in <hi>Relation</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and general <hi>Practice,</hi> and <hi>Secondly,</hi> about thoſe things that more ſtrictly referr to their own <hi>Character</hi> and <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> and diſtinguiſh them from all other <hi>Profeſſors</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity;</hi> avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two Extreams upon which many Split, <hi>viz. Perſecution</hi> and <hi>Libertiniſm.</hi> A Coercive <hi>Power</hi> to <hi>Whip</hi> People into the <hi>Temple,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:51448:24"/> that ſuch as will not Conform, though againſt <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> ſhall be puniſht in their <hi>Perſons</hi> or <hi>Eſtates;</hi> or leaving all looſe and at large, as to <hi>Practice,</hi> unaccountable to all but God and the <hi>Magiſtrate.</hi> To which hurtful Extream, nothing has more contributed than the <hi>Abuſe</hi> of <hi>Church Power,</hi> by ſuch as ſuffer their <hi>Paſſions</hi> and private <hi>Intereſts</hi> to prevail with them to carry it to outward Force and <hi>Corporal Puniſhment.</hi> A Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice they have been taught to diſlike, by their extream <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,</hi> as well as their known Principle for an univerſal <hi>Liberty of Conſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the other hand, they equally diſlike an <hi>Independency</hi> in <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</hi> An unaccountableneſs in <hi>Practice</hi> and <hi>Converſation</hi> to the Terms of their own <hi>Communion,</hi> and to thoſe that are the <hi>Members</hi> of it. They diſtinguiſh between Impoſing any Practice that immediately regards <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Worſhip,</hi> (which is never to be done nor ſuffered or ſubmitted unto) and requiring <hi>Chriſtian Compliance</hi> with thoſe Methods that <hi>only reſpect Church Buſineſs</hi> in its more <hi>Civil</hi> part and <hi>Concern,</hi> and that regard the Diſcreet and Orderly Maintenance of the Character of the <hi>Society</hi> as a <hi>Sober</hi> and <hi>Religious Community.</hi> In ſhort, what is for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> that Men may Practice what they profeſs, live up to their own <hi>Principles,</hi> and not be at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to give the <hi>Lie</hi> to their own <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> without <hi>Rebuke.</hi> They compell none to them, but oblige thoſe that are of them to walk <hi>Suitably,</hi> or they are denyed by them: That is all the Mark they ſet upon them, and the <hi>Power</hi> they Exerciſe, or Judge a Chriſtian Society, can Exerciſe upon thoſe that are the Members of it.</p>
            <p>The way of their Proceedings againſt ſuch as have <hi>Lapſt</hi> or <hi>Tranſgreſt,</hi> is this. He is viſited by ſome of them, and the matter of <hi>Fact</hi> laid <hi>Home</hi> to him, be it any evil <hi>Practice</hi> againſt known and general <hi>Virtue,</hi> or any Branch of their <hi>Particular Teſtimony,</hi> which he, in <hi>Common,</hi> profeſſeth with them. They labour with him in much <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Zeal</hi> for the good of his <hi>Soul,</hi> the Honour of <hi>God,</hi> and Reputation of their <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> to own his <hi>Fault</hi> and condemn it, <hi>in as ample a Manner as the Evil or Scandal was given by him;</hi> which for the moſt part, is performed by ſome <hi>Written Teſtimony</hi> under the Partys Hand; and if it ſo happen that the Party prove <hi>Refractory,</hi> and is not willing to clear the <hi>Truth</hi> they profeſs, from the <hi>Reproach</hi> of his or her evil doing or Unfaithfulneſs, they, after repeated <hi>Entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> and due waiting for a <hi>Token</hi> of <hi>Repentance,</hi> give forth a <hi>Paper</hi> to <hi>diſown</hi> ſuch a <hi>Fact,</hi> and the <hi>Party</hi> offending; recording the ſame as a <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of their care for the Honour of the <hi>Truth</hi> they profeſs.</p>
            <p>And if he or ſhe ſhall clear their Profeſſion and themſelves, by ſincere Acknowledgment of their <hi>Fault,</hi> and Godly ſorrow
<pb facs="tcp:51448:25"/> for ſo doing, they are received and looked upon again as <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> of their <hi>Communion.</hi> For as God, ſo his true People <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid</hi> no Man after <hi>Repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the account I had to give of the People of God called <hi>Quakers,</hi> as to their <hi>Riſe, Appearance, Principles</hi> and <hi>Practices,</hi> in this Age of the <hi>World,</hi> both with Reſpect to their <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Worſhip, Diſcipline</hi> and <hi>Converſation.</hi> And I Judge it very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in this place, becauſe it is to <hi>Preface</hi> the <hi>Journal</hi> of the firſt <hi>Bleſſed</hi> and <hi>Glorious</hi> Inſtrument of this <hi>Work,</hi> and for a <hi>Teſtimony</hi> to him in his ſingular <hi>Qualifications</hi> and <hi>Services,</hi> in which he abundantly excelled in this day, and are worthy to be ſet forth as an Example to all ſucceeding Times; to the <hi>Glory</hi> of the <hi>Moſt High God,</hi> and for a juſt <hi>Memorial</hi> to that Worthy and Excellent Man, <hi>his Faithful Servant and Apoſtle</hi> to this Generation of the World.</p>
            <p>I am now come to the Third Head or Branch of my <hi>Preface,</hi> viz. The <hi>Inſtrumental Author.</hi> For it is Natural for ſome to ſay, Well, here is the <hi>People</hi> and <hi>Work,</hi> but where and who was the <hi>Man,</hi> the <hi>Inſtrument;</hi> he that in this Age was ſent to begin this <hi>Work</hi> and <hi>People.</hi> I ſhall, as God ſhall enable me, declare who and what he was, not only by report of others, but from my own long and moſt inward <hi>Converſe</hi> and intimate know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him; for which my Soul bleſſeth God, as it hath often done; and I doubt not, but by that time I have diſcharged my ſelf of this part of my <hi>Preface,</hi> my ſerious <hi>Readers</hi> will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I had good Cauſe ſo to do.</p>
            <p>The Bleſſed Inſtrument of and in this day of God, and of whom I am now about to Write, was <hi>George Fox,</hi> diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from another of that Name, by that Other's addition of <hi>Younger</hi> to his Name in all his <hi>Writings;</hi> not that he was ſo in Years, but that he was ſo in the <hi>Truth,</hi> but he was alſo a <hi>Worthy Man,</hi> Witneſs and Servant of God in his time.</p>
            <p>But this <hi>George Fox</hi> was Born in <hi>Leiceſterſhire,</hi> about the Year 1624. He deſcended of <hi>Honeſt</hi> and <hi>Sufficient Parents,</hi> who endeavoured to bring him up, as they did the reſt of their Children, in the <hi>Way</hi> and <hi>Worſhip</hi> of the <hi>Nation;</hi> eſpecially his Mother, who was a Woman accompliſht above moſt of her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in the place where ſhe lived. But from a <hi>Child</hi> he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared of another <hi>Frame</hi> of <hi>Mind</hi> than the reſt of his <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren;</hi> being more <hi>Religious, Inward, Still, Solid</hi> and <hi>Obſerving</hi> beyond his Years, as the <hi>Anſwers</hi> he would give, and the <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions</hi> he would put upon occaſion, manifeſted to the Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe that heard him, eſpecially in <hi>Divine Things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Mother taking Notice of his <hi>Singular Temper,</hi> and the <hi>Gravity, Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Piety</hi> that very early ſhined through him,
<pb facs="tcp:51448:25"/> refuſing <hi>Childiſh</hi> and <hi>Vain Sports</hi> and <hi>Company,</hi> when very <hi>Young;</hi> ſhe was <hi>Tender</hi> and <hi>Indulgent</hi> over him, ſo that from her he met with little Difficulty. As to his <hi>Employment</hi> he was brought up in <hi>Country Buſineſs,</hi> and as he took moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in <hi>Sheep,</hi> ſo he was very skillful in them, an Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that very well ſuited his mind in ſeveral Reſpects, both for its <hi>Innocency</hi> and <hi>Solitude;</hi> and was a juſt Figure of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Miniſtry and Service.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not break in upon his own Account, which is by much the beſt that can be given, and therefore deſire, what I can, to avoid ſaying any thing of what is ſaid already, as to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Paſſages</hi> of his coming forth; but, in general, when he was ſomewhat above Twenty, he left his <hi>Friends,</hi> and viſited the moſt <hi>Retired</hi> and <hi>Religious</hi> People in thoſe Parts; and ſome there were ſhort of few, if any, in this <hi>Nation,</hi> who waited for the <hi>Conſolation</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> Night and Day; as <hi>Zache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias, Anna</hi> and good Old <hi>Simeon</hi> did of Old Time. To theſe he was ſent, and theſe he ſought out in the Neighbouring Countrys, and among them he Sojourned till his more ample <hi>Miniſtry</hi> came upon him. At this time he taught and was an Example of <hi>Silence,</hi> endeavouring to bring them from <hi>Self-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances,</hi> Teſtifying and turning to the Light of Chriſt within them, and encouraging them to wait in <hi>Patience</hi> to feel the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of it to ſtir in their <hi>Hearts,</hi> that their <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> of God might ſtand in the <hi>Power</hi> of an Endleſs Life, which was to be found in the <hi>Light,</hi> as it was obeyed in the Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of it in Man. <hi>For in the Word was Life, and that Life is the Light Men.</hi> Life in the <hi>Word,</hi> Light in <hi>Men,</hi> and Life in <hi>Men</hi> as the <hi>Light</hi> is obeyed; the Children of the <hi>Light</hi> living by the Life of the <hi>Word,</hi> by which the word <hi>begets</hi> them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to God, which is the <hi>Regeneration</hi> and <hi>New Birth,</hi> without which there is no coming unto the Kingdom of God; and which, whoever comes to, is greater than <hi>John,</hi> that is, than <hi>John</hi>'s Diſpenſation, which was not that of the Kingdom, but the Conſummation of the Legal, and Forerunning of the <hi>Goſpel Times.</hi> Accordingly, ſeveral <hi>Meetings</hi> were gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in thoſe <hi>Parts,</hi> and thus his <hi>Time</hi> was employed for ſome Years.</p>
            <p>In 1652. He being in his uſual <hi>Retirement</hi> to the Lord upon a very <hi>High Mountain,</hi> in ſome of the hither parts of <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> as I take it, his Mind exerciſed towards the <hi>Lord,</hi> he had a <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> of the great Work of God in the <hi>Earth,</hi> and of the way that he was to go forth to begin it. He ſaw People as thick as <hi>Motes in the Sun,</hi> that ſhould in time, be brought Home to the Lord; that there might be but <hi>one Shepherd and one Sheepfold</hi> in all the Earth. There his Eye was directed <hi>Northward,</hi> behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great People that ſhould receive him and his Meſſage in thoſe Parts. Upon this <hi>Mountain</hi> he was moved of the Lord
<pb facs="tcp:51448:26"/> 
               <hi>to ſound out his Great and notable Day,</hi> as if he had been in a great <hi>Auditory,</hi> and from thence went <hi>North,</hi> as the Lord had ſhown him; and in every place where he came, if not before he came to it, he had his particular <hi>Exerciſe</hi> and <hi>Service</hi> ſhown to him, ſo that the Lord was his <hi>Leader</hi> indeed; for it was not in vain that he <hi>Travailled,</hi> God in moſt places ſealing his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion</hi> with the Convincement of ſome of all ſorts, as well <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans</hi> as ſober Profeſſors of <hi>Religion.</hi> Some of the firſt and moſt Eminent of them, which are at Reſt, were <hi>Richard Farnſworth, James Nayler, William Dewsberry, Francis Howgil, Edward Burroughs, John Camm, John Audland, Richard Hub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berthorn, T. Taylor, John Aldam, T. Holmes, Alexander Parker, William Simpſon, William Caton, John Stubbs, Robert Widders, John Burnyeat, Robert Lodge, Thomas Salthouſe,</hi> and many more Worthies, that cannot be well here Named, together with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers yet living of the firſt and great Convincement, who after the knowledge of God's purging Judgments in themſelves, and ſome time of waiting in ſilence upon him, to feel and receive <hi>Power</hi> from on <hi>High</hi> to ſpeak in his Name, (which none elſe rightly can, though they may uſe the ſame Words.) They felt the <hi>Divine Motions,</hi> and were frequently drawn forth, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially to viſit the <hi>Publick Aſſemblies,</hi> to reprove, inform and exhort them, ſometimes in <hi>Markets, Fairs, Streets,</hi> and by the <hi>High-way-ſide,</hi> calling People to <hi>Repentance,</hi> and to turn to the Lord with their Hearts as well as their Mouths; directing them to the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> within them, to ſee and examine and conſider their ways by, and to eſchew the <hi>Evil</hi> and do the <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Acceptable</hi> Will of God. And they ſuffered great <hi>Hardſhips</hi> for this their <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Good-will,</hi> being often <hi>Stockt, Stoned, Beaten, Whipt</hi> and <hi>Impriſoned,</hi> though <hi>Honeſt Men</hi> and of <hi>Good Report</hi> where they lived, that had left <hi>Wives</hi> and <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> and <hi>Houſes</hi> and <hi>Lands</hi> to viſit them with a living Call to <hi>Repentance.</hi> And though the <hi>Prieſts</hi> generally ſet themſelves to oppoſe them, and write againſt them, and inſinuated moſt <hi>Falſe</hi> and <hi>Scandalous Stories</hi> to <hi>Defame</hi> them, ſtirring up the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates to ſuppreſs them, eſpecially in thoſe <hi>Northern</hi> Parts; yet God was pleaſed ſo to fill them with his living <hi>Power,</hi> and give them ſuch an open Door of utterance in his <hi>Service,</hi> that there was a mighty <hi>Convincement</hi> over thoſe Parts.</p>
            <p>And through the tender and ſingular Indulgence of Judge <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> and Judge <hi>Fell,</hi> who were wont to go that <hi>Circuit,</hi> in the Infancy of things, the <hi>Prieſts</hi> were never able to gain the point they laboured for, which was to have proceeded to <hi>Blood,</hi> and if poſſible, <hi>Herod</hi> like, by a <hi>Cruel</hi> exerciſe of the <hi>Civil Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> to have cut them off and rooted them out of the <hi>Country.</hi> Eſpecially Judge <hi>Fell,</hi> who was not only a Check to their <hi>Rage</hi> in the Courſe of <hi>Legal Proceedings,</hi> but otherwiſe upon occaſion, and finally countenanced this People; for his <hi>Wife</hi> receiving the <hi>Truth</hi> with the Firſt, it had that <hi>Influence</hi> upon his Spirit,
<pb facs="tcp:51448:26"/> being a <hi>Juſt</hi> and <hi>Wiſe Man,</hi> and ſeeing in his own <hi>Wife</hi> and <hi>Family,</hi> a full Confutation to all the popular Clamours againſt the <hi>Way of Truth,</hi> that he covered them what he could, and freely opened his <hi>Doors,</hi> and gave up his <hi>Houſe</hi> to his <hi>Wife</hi> and her <hi>Friends,</hi> not valuing the <hi>Reproach</hi> of Ignorant or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil <hi>Minded People,</hi> which I here mention, to His and her <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> and which will be I believe, an <hi>Honour</hi> and a <hi>Bleſſing</hi> to ſuch of their <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Family,</hi> as ſhall be found in that <hi>Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, Humility, Love</hi> and <hi>Zeal</hi> for the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>People</hi> of the Lord.</p>
            <p>That Houſe was for ſome Years at firſt, till the <hi>Truth</hi> had opened its way in the <hi>Southern</hi> parts of this Iſland, an Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Receptacle of this <hi>People.</hi> Others of good Note and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in thoſe <hi>Northern</hi> Countrys, had alſo opened their Houſes with their Hearts, to the many <hi>Publiſhers,</hi> that in a ſhort time the Lord had raiſed to declare his <hi>Salvation</hi> to the <hi>People,</hi> and where Meetings of the Lord's <hi>Meſſengers</hi> were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently held, to communicate their <hi>Services</hi> and <hi>Exerciſes,</hi> and <hi>Comfort</hi> and <hi>Edify</hi> one another in their <hi>Bleſſed Miniſtry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But leaſt this may be thought a Digreſſion, having touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon this before, I return to this <hi>Excellent Man:</hi> And for his <hi>Perſonal Qualities,</hi> both <hi>Natural, Moral</hi> and <hi>Divine</hi> as they appeared in his <hi>Converſe</hi> with <hi>Brethren</hi> and in the <hi>Church of God;</hi> take as follows.</p>
            <p n="1">I. He was a Man that God endued with a <hi>Clear</hi> and <hi>Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Depth,</hi> a diſcerner of others <hi>Spirits,</hi> and very much a <hi>Maſter</hi> of his own. And though the ſide of his <hi>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfaſhionable</hi> to <hi>Nice Ears,</hi> his matter was nevertheleſs very profound; and would not only bear to be often conſidered, but the more it was ſo, the more <hi>Weighty</hi> and <hi>Inſtructing</hi> it appeared. And as <hi>abruptly</hi> and <hi>bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenly</hi> as ſometimes his Sentences would fall from him, about <hi>Divine Things,</hi> it is well known they were often as <hi>Texts</hi> to many fairer <hi>Declarations.</hi> And indeed it ſhowed beyond all <hi>Contradiction</hi> that God ſent him, that no <hi>Arts</hi> or <hi>Parts</hi> had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhare in his matter or manner of his <hi>Miniſtry;</hi> and that ſo many <hi>Great, Excellent</hi> and <hi>Neceſſary Truths</hi> as he came forth to Preach to <hi>Mankind,</hi> had therefore nothing of Man's <hi>Wit</hi> or <hi>Wiſdom</hi> to recommend them. So that as to <hi>Man</hi> he was an <hi>Original,</hi> being no Man's <hi>Copy.</hi> And his <hi>Miniſtry</hi> and <hi>Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> ſhow they are from one that was not Taught of Man, nor had Learned what he ſaid by <hi>Study.</hi> Nor were they <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi> or <hi>Speculative,</hi> but ſenſible and <hi>Practical Truths,</hi> tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Converſion</hi> and <hi>Regeneration,</hi> and the ſetting up the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God in the <hi>Hearts of Men,</hi> and the way of it was his <hi>Work.</hi> So that I have many times been overcome in my ſelf,
<pb facs="tcp:51448:27"/> and been made to ſay, with my <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Maſter</hi> upon the like Occaſion; <hi>I thank thee O Father Lord of Heaven and Earth, that thou haſt hid theſe things from the Wiſe and Prudent of this World, and revealed them to Babes,</hi> For many times hath my <hi>Soul</hi> bowed in an Humble <hi>Thankfulneſs</hi> to the <hi>Lord,</hi> that he did not chooſe any of the <hi>Wiſe</hi> and <hi>Learned</hi> of this World to be the firſt <hi>Meſſenger</hi> in our <hi>Age,</hi> of his bleſſed <hi>Truth</hi> to <hi>Men;</hi> but that he took one that was not of <hi>High Degree,</hi> or <hi>Elegant Speech,</hi> or learned after the way of this World, that his <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage</hi> and <hi>Work</hi> he ſent him to do, might come with leſs <hi>Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion</hi> or <hi>Jealouſie</hi> of <hi>Humane Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Intereſt,</hi> and with more <hi>Force</hi> and <hi>Clearneſs</hi> upon the <hi>Conſciences</hi> of thoſe, that ſincerely Sought the way of <hi>Truth</hi> in the <hi>Love</hi> of it.

            </p>
            <p n="2">II. In his <hi>Teſtimony</hi> or <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> he much laboured to open <hi>Truth,</hi> to the Peoples <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings,</hi> and to bottom them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Principle,</hi> and <hi>Principal, Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> the Light of the <hi>World,</hi> that by bringing them to ſomething that was of God in themſelves, they might the better know and judge of him and themſelves.</p>
            <p>He had an Extraordinary <hi>Gift</hi> in opening the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> He would go to the <hi>Marrow</hi> of things, and ſhow the <hi>Mind, Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> and <hi>Fullfilling</hi> of them with much <hi>Plainneſs,</hi> and to great <hi>Comfort</hi> and <hi>Edification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Miſtery of the firſt and ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> of the <hi>Fall</hi> and <hi>Reſtoration,</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Goſpel,</hi> of <hi>Shadows</hi> and <hi>Subſtance,</hi> of the <hi>Servant</hi> and <hi>Sons State,</hi> and the fullfiling of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and by <hi>Chriſt</hi> the <hi>True Light,</hi> in all that are his, through the <hi>Obedience of Faith,</hi> were much of the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> and <hi>Drift</hi> of his <hi>Teſtimonies.</hi> In all which he was wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed to be of God, being ſenſibly felt to ſpeak that which he had received of Chriſt, and was his own Experience, in that which never <hi>Ers</hi> nor <hi>Fails.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But above all, he excelled in <hi>Prayer.</hi> The Inwardneſs and Weight of his <hi>Spirit,</hi> the <hi>Reverence</hi> and <hi>Solemnity</hi> of his <hi>Addreſs</hi> and <hi>Behaviour,</hi> and the <hi>Fewneſs</hi> and <hi>Fulneſs</hi> of his <hi>Words,</hi> have
<pb facs="tcp:51448:27"/> often ſtruck, even <hi>Strangers,</hi> with <hi>Admiration,</hi> as they uſed to reach others with <hi>Conſolation.</hi> The moſt <hi>Awfull, Living, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent Frame</hi> I ever Felt or Beheld, I muſt ſay was his in <hi>Prayer.</hi> And truly it was a <hi>Teſtimony</hi> he knew and lived neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to the Lord than other Men; for they that know him moſt will ſee moſt reaſon to approach him with Reverence and Fear.</p>
            <p>He was of an <hi>Innocent Life,</hi> no <hi>Buſie Body,</hi> nor <hi>Self Seeker,</hi> neither <hi>Touchy,</hi> nor <hi>Critical:</hi> What fell from him was very <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offenſive,</hi> if not very <hi>Edifying.</hi> So <hi>Meek, Contented, Modeſt, Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, Steady, Tender,</hi> it was a pleaſure to be in his <hi>Company.</hi> He exerciſed no <hi>Authority</hi> but over <hi>Evil,</hi> and that every where and in all; but with <hi>Love, Compaſſion</hi> and <hi>Long Suffering.</hi> A moſt <hi>Merciful Man,</hi> as ready to <hi>Forgive</hi> as unapt to take or give an <hi>Offence.</hi> Thouſands can truly ſay, he was of an Excellent <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Savour</hi> among them, and becauſe thereof, the moſt Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>Spirits</hi> loved him with an unfained and unfading <hi>Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was an Inceſſant <hi>Labourer;</hi> for in his Younger time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his many great and deep <hi>Sufferings</hi> and <hi>Travels</hi> had enfee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled his <hi>Body</hi> for Itinerant <hi>Services,</hi> he laboured much in the <hi>Word,</hi> and <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline</hi> in <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> turning many to God, and confirming thoſe that were convinced of the <hi>Truth,</hi> and ſetling Good Order as to <hi>Church Affairs</hi> among them. And towards the Concluſion of his <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling Services,</hi> between the Years Seventy One, and Seventy Seven, he Viſited the Churches of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Plantations in <hi>America,</hi> and in the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces,</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> as his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Journal</hi> Relates, to the Convincement and Conſolation of many. After that time he chiefly reſided in and about the City of <hi>London,</hi> and beſides the <hi>Services</hi> of his <hi>Miniſtry</hi> which were Frequent and Serviceable, he writ much both to them that are within, and thoſe that are without the <hi>Communion.</hi> But the care he took of the <hi>Affairs</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> in General was very great.</p>
            <p>He was often where the <hi>Records</hi> of the Affairs of the <hi>Church</hi> are kept, and the Letters from the many <hi>Meetings</hi> of God's People over all the World where ſettled, come upon Occaſions, which <hi>Letters</hi> he had read to him, and Communicated them to the <hi>Meeting</hi> that is Weekly held there for ſuch <hi>Services,</hi> he would be ſure to ſtir them up to diſcharge them, eſpecially in <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Caſes.</hi> Showing great <hi>Sympathy</hi> and <hi>Compaſſion</hi> upon all ſuch Occaſions, carefully looking into the <hi>Reſpective Caſes,</hi> and endeavouring <hi>Speedy Relief</hi> according to the Nature of them. So that the Churches and any of the <hi>Suffering Members</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, were ſure not to be forgotten or delayed in their Deſires if he were there.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:51448:28"/>
            <p>As he was <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nwearied,</hi> ſo he was <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndaunted</hi> in his <hi>Services</hi> for God and his People, he was no more to be moved to <hi>Fear</hi> than to <hi>Wrath.</hi> His Behaviour at <hi>Darby, Litchfield, Appleby,</hi> before <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> at <hi>Launſton, Scarborough, Worceſter</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> with many other Places and Exerciſes, did abundantly evidence it to his Enemies as well as his Friends.</p>
            <p>But as in the <hi>Primitive Times,</hi> ſome riſe up againſt the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Apoſtles</hi> of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> even from among thoſe that they had turned to the Hope of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came their greateſt Trouble; ſo this <hi>Man of God</hi> had his ſhare of <hi>Suffering</hi> from ſome that were convinced by him, who through prejudice or miſtake run againſt him, as one that ſought Dominion over <hi>Conſcience;</hi> becauſe he preſt by his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence or Epiſtles, a ready and zealous compliance with ſuch good and wholeſome things, as tended to an <hi>Orderly Converſation</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Affairs of the <hi>Church,</hi> and in their walking before Men. That which contributed much to this ill <hi>Work,</hi> was in ſome a begrudging of this <hi>Meek Man,</hi> the love and eſteem he had and deſerved in the Hearts of the People, and weakneſs in others, that were taken with their groundleſs Suggeſtions of <hi>Impoſition</hi> and blind <hi>Obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They would have had every Man <hi>Independent,</hi> that as he had the <hi>Principle</hi> in himſelf, he ſhould only ſtand and fall to that and no Body elſe; not conſidering that the <hi>Principle</hi> is <hi>One</hi> in all; and though the Meaſure of <hi>Light</hi> or <hi>Grace</hi> might dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, yet the Nature of it was the ſame, and being ſo, they ſtruck at the <hi>Spiritual <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> which a People, guided by the ſame <hi>Principle,</hi> are naturally led into: So that what is an evil to One, is ſo to All, and what is <hi>Vertuous, Honeſt</hi> and of good <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi> to <hi>One,</hi> is ſo to All, from the Senſe and Savour of the one <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Principle</hi> which is common to all, (and which the diſaffected profeſs to be) the Root of all <hi>True Chriſtian Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip,</hi> and that Spirit into which the People of God drink and come to be <hi>Spiritually Minded,</hi> and of one <hi>Heart</hi> and one <hi>Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some weakly miſtook good <hi>Order</hi> in the <hi>Government</hi> of <hi>Church Affairs,</hi> for <hi>Diſcipline</hi> in <hi>Worſhip,</hi> and that it was ſo preſt or recommended by Him and other Brethren: And they were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to reflect the ſame things that <hi>Diſſenters</hi> had very reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably objected upon the <hi>National Churches,</hi> that have coercively preſſed Conformity to their <hi>Reſpective Creeds</hi> and <hi>Worſhips:</hi> Whereas theſe things related wholly to <hi>Converſation,</hi> and the <hi>Outward</hi> (and as I may ſay) <hi>Civil</hi> part of the <hi>Church,</hi> that Men ſhould walk up to the Principles of their <hi>Belief,</hi> and not be wanting in <hi>Care</hi> and <hi>Charity.</hi> But though ſome have ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and fallen through <hi>Miſtakes,</hi> and an unreaſonable <hi>Obſtinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> even to a <hi>Prejudice;</hi> yet bleſſed be God, the Generality have returned to their <hi>Firſt Love,</hi> and ſeen the Work of the <hi>Enemy,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:51448:28"/> that looſes no <hi>Opportunity</hi> or <hi>Advantage</hi> by which he may check or hinder the <hi>Work</hi> of God, and diſquiet the <hi>Peace</hi> of his <hi>Church,</hi> and chill the <hi>Love</hi> of his People to the <hi>Truth</hi> and one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and there is hope of divers that are yet at a Diſtance.</p>
            <p>In all theſe Occaſions, though there was no Perſon the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented ſtruck ſo ſharply at, as this <hi>Good Man,</hi> he bore all their <hi>Weakneſs</hi> and <hi>Prejudice,</hi> and returned not <hi>Reflection</hi> for <hi>Reflection;</hi> but forgave them their weak and bitter <hi>Speeches,</hi> praying for them that they might have a Senſe of their hurt, and ſee the <hi>Subtilty</hi> of the <hi>Enemy</hi> to Rend and Devide, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into their <hi>Firſt Love, that thought no Ill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And truly, I muſt ſay, that though God had viſibly cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with a <hi>Divine Preference</hi> and <hi>Authority,</hi> and indeed his very Preſence expreſt a <hi>Religious Majeſty;</hi> yet he never abuſed it, but held his Place in the <hi>Church of God</hi> with great Meak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and a moſt engaging <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Moderation.</hi> For upon all Occaſions, like his bleſſed <hi>Maſter,</hi> he was a <hi>Servant</hi> to all; holding and exerciſing his Elderſhip, in the <hi>Inviſible Power</hi> that had gathered them, with Reverence to the Head and Care o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Body: And was received only in that <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> of Chriſt as the <hi>Firſt</hi> and <hi>Chief Elder</hi> in this <hi>Age;</hi> who, as he was therefore worthy of double <hi>Honour,</hi> ſo for the ſame Reaſon it was given by the <hi>Faithful</hi> of this day; becauſe his <hi>Authority</hi> was inward and not outward, and that he got it and kept it by the Love of God and Power of an <hi>Endleſs Life.</hi> I write my <hi>Knowledge</hi> and not <hi>Report,</hi> and my <hi>Witneſs is True,</hi> having been with him for <hi>Weeks</hi> and <hi>Months</hi> together on di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <hi>Occaſions,</hi> and thoſe of the neareſt and moſt exerciſing Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that by Night and by Day, by Sea and by Land; in this and in <hi>Foreign Countrys:</hi> And I can ſay, I never ſaw him out of his Place, or not a Match for every Service or Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>For in all things he acquitted himſelf like a Man, yea a ſtrong Man, a <hi>New</hi> and <hi>Heavenly</hi> minded Man. A <hi>Divine</hi> and a <hi>Naturaliſt,</hi> and all of God Almighty's making. I have been ſurpriſed at his <hi>Queſtions</hi> and <hi>Anſwers</hi> in Natural things; that whilſt he was Ignorant of uſeleſs and Sophiſtical <hi>Science,</hi> he had in him the <hi>Foundation</hi> of uſeful and commendable <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> and cheriſht it every where. <hi>Civil</hi> beyond all Forms of <hi>Breeding,</hi> in his <hi>Behaviour.</hi> Very <hi>Temperate,</hi> eating <hi>Little,</hi> and ſleeping <hi>Leſs,</hi> though a <hi>Bulky Perſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus he Lived and Sojourned among us, and as he lived, ſo he died; feeling the ſame <hi>Eternal Power</hi> that had raiſed and preſerved him in his laſt <hi>Moments.</hi> So full of aſſurance was he, that he Triumpht over <hi>Death;</hi> and ſo even to the laſt, as if <hi>Death</hi> were hardly worth <hi>Notice</hi> or a <hi>Mention:</hi> Recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:51448:29"/> to ſome with him, the <hi>Diſpatch</hi> and <hi>Diſperſion</hi> of an <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> juſt before Written to the <hi>Churches of Chriſt,</hi> throughout the World, and his own Books; but above all, <hi>Friends,</hi> and of all <hi>Friends,</hi> thoſe in <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> twice over. Saying, mind poor <hi>Friends</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to ſome that came in and enquired how he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he anſwered, <hi>Never heed, the Lord's Power is over all Weakneſs and Death, the Seed reigns, Bleſſed be the Lord:</hi> Which was about Four or Five Hours before his Departure out of this World. He was at the great <hi>Meeting</hi> near <hi>Lombard-ſtreet</hi> on the Firſt day of the Week, and it was the Third follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about Ten at Night when he left us; being at the Houſe of <hi>H.

            <p>And now, <hi>Friends,</hi> you that profeſs to walk in the way, this <hi>Bleſſed Man</hi> was ſent of God to turn us into, ſuffer I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you the word of <hi>Exhortation,</hi> as well <hi>Fathers</hi> as <hi>Children,</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi> as <hi>Young Men.</hi> The Glory of this Day and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Hope that has not made us aſhamed ſince we were a <hi>People,</hi> you know is that <hi>Bleſſed Principle</hi> of Light and Life of <hi>Chriſt</hi> which we Profeſs, and Direct all People to, as the great <hi>Inſtrument</hi> and <hi>Agent</hi> of Man's Converſion to God: It was by this we were firſt Touched, and effectually enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as to our Inward State, which put us upon the <hi>Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of our <hi>Latter End,</hi> cauſing us to ſet the Lord before our <hi>Eyes,</hi> and to Number our <hi>Days,</hi> that we might apply our <hi>Hearts</hi> to <hi>Wiſdom.</hi> In that Day we judged not after the Sight of the <hi>Eye,</hi> or after the <hi>Hearing</hi> of the <hi>Ear,</hi> but according to the <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Senſe</hi> this <hi>Bleſſed Principle</hi> gave us; we judged and acted in reference to Things and Perſons, our ſelves and others, yea, towards God our <hi>Maker.</hi> For being quickned by it in our <hi>Inward Man,</hi> we could eaſily diſcern the difference of things, and feel what was <hi>Right,</hi> and what was <hi>Wrong,</hi> and what was <hi>Fit</hi> and what not, both in reference to <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Civil</hi> Concerns. That being the ground of the <hi>Fellowſhip</hi> of all <hi>Saints,</hi> it was in that our <hi>Fellowſhip</hi> ſtood. In this we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
<pb facs="tcp:51448:29"/> to have a <hi>Senſe</hi> one of another, acted towards one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and all Men, in <hi>Love, Faithfulneſs</hi> and <hi>Fear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the feeling of the <hi>Motions</hi> of this <hi>Principle</hi> we drew near to the Lord, and waited to be prepared by it, that we might feel thoſe <hi>Drawings</hi> and <hi>Movings,</hi> before we approached the <hi>Lord in Prayer,</hi> or open'd our <hi>Mouths</hi> in <hi>Miniſtry.</hi> And in our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and Ending with this, ſtood our <hi>Comfort, Service</hi> and <hi>Edification.</hi> And as we run faſter, or fell ſhort we made <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> for our ſelves to bear; our Services finding in our ſelves a <hi>Rebuke</hi> inſtead of an <hi>Acceptance,</hi> and in lieu of <hi>Well done, who has required this at your Hands?</hi> In that day we were an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed People,</hi> our very Countenances and Deportment declared it.</p>
            <p>Care for others was then much upon us, as well as for our ſelves, eſpecially the <hi>Young Convinced.</hi> Often had we the <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi> of the <hi>Word</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> to our <hi>Neighbours, Relations</hi> and <hi>Acquaintance;</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Strangers</hi> alſo, We were in <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail</hi> for one anothers <hi>Preſervation:</hi> Not ſeeking, but ſhunning Occaſions of any <hi>Coldneſs</hi> or <hi>Miſunderſtanding,</hi> treating one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as thoſe that believed and felt God preſent. Which kept our Converſation <hi>Innocent, Serious</hi> and <hi>Weighty,</hi> guarding our ſelves againſt the <hi>Cares</hi> and <hi>Friendſhips</hi> of the World. We held the <hi>Truth</hi> in the <hi>Spirit</hi> of it, and not in our own <hi>Spirits,</hi> or after our own <hi>Wills</hi> and <hi>Affections.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They were bowed and brought into <hi>Subjection,</hi> in ſo much that it was viſible to them that knew us, we did not think our ſelves at our own <hi>Diſpoſe,</hi> to go where we <hi>Liſt,</hi> or ſay or do what we <hi>Liſt,</hi> or when we <hi>Liſt.</hi> Our <hi>Liberty</hi> ſtood in the <hi>Liberty</hi> of the <hi>Spirit of Truth,</hi> and no <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> no <hi>Profit,</hi> no <hi>Fear</hi> no <hi>Favour</hi> could draw us from this retired, ſtrict and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Frame.</hi> We were ſo far from ſeeking occaſions of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,</hi> that we avoided them what we could; perſuing our own Buſineſs with <hi>Moderation,</hi> inſtead of medling with other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nneceſſarily.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our <hi>Words</hi> were <hi>Few</hi> and <hi>Savoury,</hi> our <hi>Looks Compoſed</hi> and <hi>Weighty,</hi> and our whole <hi>Deportment</hi> very <hi>Obſervable.</hi> True it is, that this Retired and ſtrict ſort of <hi>Life</hi> from the <hi>Liberty</hi> of the <hi>Converſation of the World,</hi> expoſed us to the Cenſures of many, as <hi>Humouriſts, Conceited</hi> and <hi>Self-righteous Perſons,</hi> &amp;c. But it was our <hi>Preſervation</hi> from many <hi>Snares,</hi> to which others were continually expoſed by the <hi>Prevalency</hi> of the luſt of the <hi>Eye,</hi> the luſt of the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and the <hi>Pride</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> that wanted no Occaſions or Temptations to excite them abroad in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe of the World.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:51448:30"/>
            <p>I cannot forget the <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Chaſt Zeal</hi> of that Day. Oh! how Conſtant at <hi>Meetings,</hi> how Retired in them, how firm to <hi>Truth's Life,</hi> as well as <hi>Truth's Principles;</hi> and how <hi>Entire</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited</hi> in our <hi>Communion,</hi> as indeed became thoſe that profeſs <hi>One Head,</hi> even Chriſt Jeſus the Lord.</p>
            <p>This being the Teſtimony and Example the Man of God, before mentioned, was ſent to <hi>Declare</hi> and <hi>Leave</hi> amongſt us, and we having Embraced the ſame as the <hi>Merciful Viſitation</hi> of God to us, the <hi>Word of Exhortation</hi> at this time is, that we continue to be <hi>found</hi> in the Way of this <hi>Teſtimony</hi> with all <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Integrity,</hi> and ſo much the more, by how much the Day draweth near.</p>
            <p>And Firſt, as to you, my <hi>Beloved</hi> and much <hi>Honoured Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> in Chriſt, that are in the Exerciſe of the <hi>Miniſtry:</hi> Oh, feel Life in the <hi>Miniſtry!</hi> Let Life be your <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> your <hi>Well-ſpring</hi> and <hi>Treaſury</hi> in all ſuch Occaſions, elſe you well know, there can be no begetting to God, ſince nothing can quicken or make People alive to God, but the life of God: And it muſt be a <hi>Miniſtry</hi> in and from Life, that enlivens any People to God. We have ſeen the <hi>Fruit</hi> of all other <hi>Miniſtrys</hi> by the few that are turned from the <hi>Evil</hi> of their <hi>Ways.</hi> It is not our <hi>Parts,</hi> or <hi>Memory,</hi> the repetition of former <hi>Openings</hi> in our own will and time, that will do God's <hi>Work.</hi> A dry <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinal Miniſtry,</hi> however ſound in Words, can reach but the <hi>Ear,</hi> and is but a <hi>Dream</hi> at the Beſt: There is another <hi>Sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> that is ſoundeſt of all, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt the power of God. This is the <hi>Key</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> that <hi>Opens</hi> and none <hi>Shuts,</hi> and <hi>Shuts,</hi> and none can <hi>Open;</hi> as the Oil to the <hi>Lamp,</hi> and the <hi>Soul</hi> to the <hi>Body,</hi> ſo is that to the beſt of <hi>Words.</hi> Which made Chriſt to ſay, <hi>My Words they are Spirit, and they are Life;</hi> that is, they are from Life, and therefore they make you alive, that <hi>receive</hi> them. If the <hi>Diſciples</hi> that had lived with <hi>Jeſus,</hi> were to ſtay at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> till they received it; ſo muſt we wait to receive, before we <hi>Miniſter,</hi> if we will turn People from <hi>Darkneſs</hi> to <hi>Light,</hi> and from <hi>Satan</hi>'s power to God.</p>
            <p>I fervently bow my Knees to the God and Father of our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that you may always be like minded, that you may ever wait <hi>Reverently</hi> for the coming and opening of the <hi>Word of Life,</hi> and tend upon it in your <hi>Miniſtry</hi> and <hi>Service,</hi> that you may ſerve God in his <hi>Spirit.</hi> And be it little, or be it much, it is well; for much is not too much, and the leaſt is enough, if from the motion of <hi>God's Spirit;</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, verily, never ſo little is too much, becauſe to no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.</p>
            <p>For it is the <hi>Spirit of the Lord</hi> immediately, or through the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> of his <hi>Servants,</hi> that teacheth his People to profit; and
<pb facs="tcp:51448:30"/> to be ſure, ſo far as we take him, along with us in our <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,</hi> ſo far we are profitable and no farther. For if it be the Lord that muſt work all things in us and for our ſelves; much more is it the <hi>Lord,</hi> that muſt work in us for the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion</hi> of others. If therefore it was once a <hi>Croſs</hi> to us to <hi>Speak,</hi> though the Lord required it at our Hands; let it never be ſo to be ſilent, when he does not.</p>
            <p>It is one of the moſt dreadful <hi>Sayings</hi> in the <hi>Book of God,</hi> That he that adds to the <hi>Words</hi> of the Prophecy of this <hi>Book,</hi> God will add the <hi>Plagues</hi> written in this <hi>Book.</hi> To keep back the Counſel of God, is as Terrible; for he that takes away from the <hi>Words</hi> of the <hi>Prophecy</hi> of this <hi>Book,</hi> God ſhall take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his part out of the <hi>Book of Life.</hi> And truly, it has great <hi>Caution</hi> in it to thoſe, that uſe the Name of the Lord, to be well aſſured, the <hi>Lord Speaks,</hi> that they may not be found of the Number of thoſe, that add to the <hi>Words</hi> of the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> which the <hi>Lord</hi> giveth them to bear; nor yet to mince or diminiſh the ſame, both being ſo very offenſive to God.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, <hi>Brethren,</hi> let us be careful neither to out-go our <hi>Guide,</hi> nor yet loiter behind him; ſince he that makes <hi>Haſte,</hi> may miſs his <hi>Way,</hi> and he that ſtays behind, looſe his <hi>Guide:</hi> For even thoſe, that have Received the <hi>Word of the Lord,</hi> had need wait for <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> that they may ſee how to divide the <hi>Word</hi> aright; which plainly implieth that it is poſſible for one, that hath received the <hi>Word of the Lord,</hi> to miſs in the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion</hi> and <hi>Application</hi> of it, which muſt come from an <hi>Impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency</hi> of <hi>Spirit,</hi> and a <hi>Self-working,</hi> which makes an unſound and dangerous <hi>Mixture;</hi> and will hardly beget a right minded li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving People to God.</p>
            <p>I am earneſt in this, above all other Conſiderations, as to publick <hi>Brethren,</hi> well knowing how much it concerns the preſent and future <hi>State,</hi> and preſervation of the <hi>Church of Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> that has been gathered and built up by a <hi>Living</hi> and <hi>Powerful Miniſtry,</hi> that the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> be held, preſerved and continued in the <hi>Manifeſtations, Motions</hi> and <hi>Supplies</hi> of the ſame <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> from time to time.</p>
            <p>And where ever it is obſerved, that any one does <hi>Miniſter</hi> more from <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Parts,</hi> than <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> though they have an <hi>Inlightned</hi> and <hi>Doctrinal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding;</hi> let them in time be adviſed and admoniſhed for their <hi>Preſervation,</hi> becauſe inſenſibly ſuch will come to depend upon a <hi>Self-ſufficiency;</hi> to forſake Chriſt the living <hi>Fountain,</hi> and to hew out unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>Ciſterns</hi> that will hold no living <hi>Waters;</hi> and by degrees draw others from waiting upon the <hi>Gift of God</hi> in themſelves, and to feel it in others, in order to their <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:51448:31"/> to wait upon them, and to turn from <hi>God</hi> to <hi>Man</hi> again, and ſo to make <hi>Shipwrack</hi> of the <hi>Faith</hi> once delivered to the <hi>Saints,</hi> and of a good <hi>Conſcience</hi> towards God; which are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kept by that <hi>Divine Gift</hi> of life, that begat the one and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken'd and ſanctified the other in the Beginning.</p>
            <p>Nor is it enough that we have known the <hi>Divine Gift,</hi> and in it have reached to the <hi>Spirits</hi> in <hi>Priſon,</hi> and been the <hi>Inſtruments</hi> of the <hi>Convincing</hi> of others of the way of God, if we keep not as low and poor in our ſelves, and as depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Lord as ever; ſince no <hi>Memory,</hi> no <hi>Repetitions</hi> of former <hi>Openings, Revelations</hi> or <hi>Enjoyments</hi> will bring a <hi>Soul</hi> to God, or afford <hi>Bread</hi> to the <hi>Hungry,</hi> or <hi>Water</hi> to the <hi>Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,</hi> unleſs Life go, with what we ſay, and that muſt be wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for.</p>
            <p>O that we may have no other <hi>Fountain, Treaſury</hi> or <hi>Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence!</hi> that none may preſume at any rate to Act of themſelves for <hi>God!</hi> Becauſe they have long acted from <hi>God,</hi> that we may not ſupply want of waiting with our own <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> or think that we may take leſs Care, and more liberty in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than formerly; and that where we do not feel the Lord by his Power to open us and enlarge us, whatever be the <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation</hi> of the <hi>People,</hi> or has been our <hi>Cuſtomary Supply</hi> and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,</hi> we may not exceed or fill up the time with our own.</p>
            <p>I hope, we ſhall ever Remember, who it was that ſaid, <hi>Of your ſelves you can do nothing,</hi> our ſufficiency is in Him: And if we are not to ſpeak our own <hi>Words,</hi> or take Thought what we ſhould ſay to Men in our <hi>Defence,</hi> when expoſed for our <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> ſurely, we ought to ſpeak none of our own <hi>Words,</hi> or take Thought what we ſhall ſay in our <hi>Teſtimony</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry</hi> in the <hi>Name of the Lord</hi> to the <hi>Souls</hi> of the <hi>People;</hi> for then of all Times, and of all other Occaſions ſhould it be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in us; <hi>for it is not you that ſpeak, but the Spirit of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that ſpeaketh in you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed, the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> muſt and does keep its <hi>Analogy</hi> and <hi>Agreement</hi> with the <hi>Birth</hi> of the <hi>Spirit;</hi> that as no Man can <hi>Inherit the Kingdom of God, unleſs he be born of the Spirit;</hi> ſo no Miniſtery can beget a <hi>Soul</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> but that which is from the <hi>Spirit.</hi> For this, as I ſaid before, the <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> waited before they went forth; and in this our <hi>Elder Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> and <hi>Meſſengers</hi> of God in our <hi>Day,</hi> waited, viſited and reached to us. And having begun in the Spirit, let none ever hope or ſeek to be made perfect in the <hi>Fleſh:</hi> For what is the <hi>Fleſh</hi> to the <hi>Spirit,</hi> or the <hi>Chaff</hi> to the <hi>Wheat?</hi> And if we keep in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> we ſhall keep in the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of it, which is the ground of true <hi>Fellowſhip.</hi> For by <hi>Drinking</hi> into that one <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> we are made one People to God, and by it we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<pb facs="tcp:51448:31"/> in the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of the <hi>Faith,</hi> and the <hi>Bond</hi> of <hi>Peace.</hi> No <hi>Envying,</hi> no <hi>Bitterneſs,</hi> no <hi>Strife</hi> can have place with us. We ſhall watch always for <hi>Good,</hi> and not for <hi>Evil</hi> over one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and <hi>rejoice</hi> exceedingly, and not begrudge at one anothers increaſe in the <hi>Riches</hi> of the <hi>Grace,</hi> with which God repleniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his <hi>Faithful Servants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, <hi>Brethren,</hi> as to you is committed the <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> of the <hi>Oracles of God,</hi> which give you frequent Opportunities, and great Place with the People among whom you <hi>Travail,</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you that you would not think it ſufficient to declare the <hi>Word of Life</hi> in their <hi>Aſſemblies,</hi> however <hi>Edifying</hi> and <hi>Comfortable</hi> ſuch opportunities may be to you and them: But as was the <hi>Practice</hi> of the <hi>Man of God</hi> before mentioned, in great <hi>Meaſure,</hi> when among us, inquire the State of the ſeveral <hi>Churches</hi> you Viſit; who among them are <hi>Afflicted</hi> or <hi>Sick,</hi> who are <hi>Tempted;</hi> if any are <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfaithful</hi> or <hi>Obſtinate,</hi> and endeavour to Iſſue thoſe things in the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which will be a glorious <hi>Crown</hi> upon your <hi>Miniſtry.</hi> As that prepares your way in the Hearts of the People to receive you as Men of God, ſo it gives you Credit with them to do them good by your <hi>Advice</hi> in other Reſpects. The <hi>Afflicted</hi> will be <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted</hi> by you, the <hi>Tempted</hi> Strengthened, the <hi>Sick</hi> Refreſhed, the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfaithful</hi> Convicted and Reſtored, and ſuch as are <hi>Obſtinate Softned</hi> and fitted for <hi>Reconciliation,</hi> which is Clenching the <hi>Nail,</hi> and applying and Faſtning the general <hi>Teſtimony</hi> by that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Care of the ſeveral Branches of it, in reference to them more immediately concerned in it.</p>
            <p>For though <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Wiſe Men</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi> too, may reſide in ſuch places, who are of Worth and Importance in the general, and in other Places; yet it does not always follow, that they may have the Room they deſerve in the hearts of the People they live among; or ſome particular occaſion may make it unfit for him or them to uſe that <hi>Authority.</hi> But you that Travail as God's <hi>Meſſengers,</hi> if they receive you in the Greater, ſhall they refuſe you in the Leſs? And if they own the general <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> can they withſtand the particular <hi>Application</hi> of it in their own Caſes? Thus, ye will ſhew your ſelves <hi>Workmen</hi> indeed, and carry your Buſineſs before you, to the praiſe of his Name that hath called you from <hi>Darkneſs</hi> to <hi>Light,</hi> that you might turn o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from <hi>Satan</hi>'s Power unto God and his Kingdom, which is within. And Oh that there were more of ſuch Faithful <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers</hi> in the <hi>Vineyard</hi> of the Lord! Never more need ſince the day of God!</p>
            <p>Wherefore I cannot but <hi>Cry</hi> and <hi>Call</hi> aloud to you, that have been long Profeſſors of the <hi>Truth,</hi> and know the <hi>Truth</hi> in the convincing Power of it, and have had a ſober <hi>Converſation</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Men, yet content your ſelves only to know <hi>Truth</hi> for
<pb facs="tcp:51448:32"/> your ſelves; to go to <hi>Meetings,</hi> and Exerciſe an ordinary <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> and an honeſt <hi>Behaviour</hi> in the <hi>World,</hi> and limit your ſelves within thoſe Bounds, feeling little or no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern upon your <hi>Spirits</hi> for the Glory of the Lord in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirity of his <hi>Truth</hi> in the Earth, more than to be glad that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſucceed in ſuch Service; Ariſe ye in the Name and <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> of the <hi>Lord Jeſus!</hi> Behold, how white the <hi>Fields</hi> are unto <hi>Harveſt</hi> in this and other <hi>Nations,</hi> and how few Able and <hi>Faithful Labourers</hi> there are to work therein! Your <hi>Country Folks, Neighbours</hi> and <hi>Kindred</hi> want to know the Lord and his Truth, and to Walk in it. Does nothing lie at your Door upon their Account? Search and ſee, and looſe no time, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, for the Lord is at Hand. I do not Judge you, there is one that Judgeth all Men, and his Judgment is true: You have mightily increaſed in your outward <hi>Subſtance;</hi> may you equally increaſe in your inward <hi>Riches,</hi> and do good with both, while you have a day to do <hi>Good.</hi> Your Enemies would once have taken what you had from you, for his Names Sake, in whom you have believed; wherefore he has given you much of the <hi>World</hi> in the Face of your <hi>Enemies.</hi> But Oh let it be your <hi>Servant</hi> and not your <hi>Maſter,</hi> your <hi>Diverſion</hi> rather than your <hi>Buſineſs!</hi> Let the Lord be chiefly in your Eye, and ponder your Ways, and ſee if God has nothing more for you to do; and if you find your ſelves ſhort in your Account with him, then wait for his <hi>Preparation,</hi> and be ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the word of Command, and be not weary of <hi>well doing,</hi> when you have put your Hand to the <hi>Plow;</hi> and aſſuredly you ſhall Reap (if you faint not) the Fruit of your Heavenly La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in God's Everlaſting Kingdom.</p>
            <p>And you, Young Convinced Ones, be you Entreated and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to a Diligent and Chaſt waiting upon God, in the way of his <hi>Bleſſed Manifeſtation</hi> and appearance of himſelf to you. Look not out, but within: Let not anothers <hi>Liberty</hi> be your Snare. Neither Act by <hi>Imitation,</hi> but <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Feeling</hi> of God's Power in your ſelves: Cruſh not the tender <hi>Buddings</hi> of it in your <hi>Souls,</hi> nor over run in your deſires, and your warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Affections</hi> the Holy and Gentle Motions of It. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it is a ſtill <hi>Voice</hi> that Speaks to us in this Day, and that it is not to be heard in the <hi>Noiſes</hi> and <hi>Hurries</hi> of the <hi>Mind;</hi> but is diſtinctly underſtood in a retired Frame. Jeſus loved and choſe out <hi>Solitudes;</hi> often going to <hi>Mountains,</hi> to <hi>Gardens</hi> and <hi>Sea-ſides</hi> to avoid <hi>Crowds</hi> and <hi>Hurries,</hi> to ſhew his <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> it was good to be <hi>Solitary,</hi> and ſit looſe to the World. Two Enemies lie near your <hi>States, Imagination</hi> and <hi>Liberty,</hi> but the plain, practical, Living, Holy Truth, that has convinced you will preſerve you, if you mind it in your ſelves, and bring all Thoughts, Imaginations and Affections to the Teſt of it, to ſee if they are wrought in God, or of the Enemy, or your own ſelves: So will a true <hi>Taſt, Diſcerning</hi> and <hi>Judgment</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:51448:32"/> be preſerved to you, of what you ſhould do and leave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done: And in your diligence and Faithfulneſs in this way you will come to inherit Subſtance; and Chriſt, the Eternal Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, will fill your <hi>Treaſury.</hi> And when you are Converted, as well as Convinced, then confirm your <hi>Brethren,</hi> and be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to every good <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Work,</hi> that the Lord ſhall call you to; that you may be to his Praiſe, who has choſen you to be partakers with the <hi>Saints</hi> in <hi>Light</hi> of a Kingdom that cannot be ſhaken, an Inheritance incorruptible, in <hi>Eternal Habitations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, as for you that are the Children of God's People, a Great Concern is upon my Spirit for your good; and often are my Knees Bowed to the God of your <hi>Fathers</hi> for you, that you may come to be partakers of the ſame <hi>Divine Life</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> that has been the <hi>Glory</hi> of this Day; that a Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you may be to <hi>God,</hi> an <hi>Holy Nation</hi> and a <hi>Peculiar People, Zealous</hi> of <hi>Good Works,</hi> when all our <hi>Heads</hi> are laid in the <hi>Duſt.</hi> Oh you <hi>Young Men</hi> and <hi>Women,</hi> let it not ſuffice you, that you are the Children of the People of the <hi>Lord!</hi> you muſt alſo be born again, if you will inherit the Kingdom of God. Your Fathers are but ſuch after the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and could but beget you into the likeneſs of the firſt <hi>Adam;</hi> but you muſt be begotten into the likeneſs of the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> by a <hi>Spiritual Generation.</hi> And therefore look carefully about you, Oh ye <hi>Children</hi> of the <hi>Children</hi> of God, Conſider your <hi>Standing,</hi> and ſee what you are in Relation to this <hi>Divine Kindred, Family</hi> and <hi>Birth!</hi> Have you obeyed the <hi>Light,</hi> and received and walked in the Spirit, that is the <hi>incorruptible</hi> Seed of the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> of which you muſt be born again: God is no reſpecter of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. The Father cannot ſave or anſwer for the <hi>Child,</hi> the <hi>Child</hi> for the Father, <hi>but in the Sin thou Sinneſt, thou ſhalt die; and in the Righteouſneſs thou doeſt, through Chriſt Jeſus, thou ſhalt live;</hi> for it is the <hi>Willing</hi> and <hi>Obedient</hi> that ſhall eat the <hi>Good</hi> of the <hi>Land.</hi> Be not deceived, God is not mocked, ſuch as all <hi>Nations</hi> and <hi>People</hi> Sow, ſuch they ſhall reap at the hand of the juſt God. And then your many and great Priviledges, above the Children of other People, will add weight in the ſcale a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, if you chooſe not the way of the Lord. For you have had Line upon Line, and Precept upon Precept, and not only <hi>good Doctrine,</hi> but <hi>good Example;</hi> and which is more, you have been turned to and acquainted with a Principle in your ſelves, which others have been ignorant of; and you know, you may be as Good as you pleaſe, without the Fear of Frowns and Blows, or being turned out of doors and forſaken of <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Mother</hi> for God's Sake, and his Holy Religion, as has been the Caſe of ſome of your <hi>Fathers</hi> in the day they firſt entred into this <hi>Holy Path:</hi> And if you, after hearing and ſeeing the Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that God has wrought in the deliverance and perſervation of them, through a <hi>Sea</hi> of <hi>Troubles,</hi> and the manifold Temporal, as well as ſpiritual Bleſſings, that he has filled them with in the
<pb facs="tcp:51448:33"/> ſight of their Enemies, you ſhould neglect and turn your backs upon ſo great and ſo near a <hi>Salvation,</hi> you would not only be moſt ungreatful <hi>Children</hi> to God and them, but muſt expect that God will call the Children of thoſe that knew him not, to take the <hi>Crown</hi> out of your Hands, and that your lot will be a dreadful Judgment at the hand of the Lord. But Oh that it may never be ſo with any of you! The Lord forbid, ſaith my <hi>Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore, Oh ye <hi>Young Men</hi> and <hi>Women,</hi> look to the Rock of your <hi>Fathers!</hi> chuſe the God of your <hi>Fathers:</hi> There is no other God but him; no other <hi>Light</hi> but his; no other <hi>Grace</hi> but his, nor <hi>Spirit,</hi> but his to Convince you, Quicken and Comfort you; to Lead, Guide and Preſerve you to God's <hi>Everlaſting Kingdom:</hi> So will you be Poſſeſſors, as well as Profeſſors of the <hi>Truth;</hi> embracing it not only by <hi>Education</hi> but <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Conviction,</hi> from a Senſe begotten in your <hi>Souls,</hi> through the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the <hi>Eternal Spirit</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of God in your hearts, by which you may come to be the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> through Faith, and the circumciſion not made with Hands, and ſo heirs of the promiſe made to the <hi>Fathers</hi> of an Incorruptible <hi>Crown:</hi> That (as I ſaid before) a <hi>Generation</hi> you may be to God, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the Profeſſion of the bleſſed <hi>Truth</hi> in the <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of it. For <hi>Formality</hi> in <hi>Religion</hi> is Nauſeous to God and good Men; and the more ſo, where any Form or Appearance has been new and peculiar, and begun and practiſed upon a Principle, with an Uncommon <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Strictneſs.</hi> Therefore I ſay, for you to fall flat and formal, and continue the profeſſion without that <hi>Salt</hi> and <hi>Savour,</hi> by which it is come to obtain a good Report among Men, is not to anſwer God's Love, nor your Parents Care, nor the mind of <hi>Truth</hi> in your ſelves, nor in thoſe that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; who tho' they will not obey the Truth, have <hi>Sight</hi> and <hi>Senſe</hi> enough to ſee if they do that make a Profeſſion of it. For where the <hi>Divine Virtue</hi> of it is not felt in the <hi>Soul,</hi> and waited for, and lived in, imperfections will quickly break out, and ſhew themſelves, and detect the Unfaithfulneſs of ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and that their inſides are not ſeaſoned with the Nature of that holy <hi>Principle</hi> which they profeſs.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, Dear <hi>Children,</hi> let met intreat you to ſhut your Eyes at the <hi>Temptations</hi> and <hi>Allurements</hi> of this low and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing World, and not ſuffer your affections to be captivated by thoſe <hi>Luſts</hi> and <hi>Vanities</hi> that your <hi>Fathers,</hi> for Truths Sake, long ſince turned their Backs upon: But as you believe it to be the <hi>Truth,</hi> receive it into your Hearts, that you may become the <hi>Children of God:</hi> So that it may never be ſaid of you, as the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> Writes of the <hi>Jews</hi> of his time, That Chriſt, the true <hi>Light,</hi> came to his own, but his own received him not; but to as many as received him, to them he gave <hi>Power</hi> to become the <hi>Children of God; which were born, not of Blood, nor of the
<pb facs="tcp:51448:33"/> Will of the Fleſh, nor of the Will of Man, but of God.</hi> A moſt cloſe and comprehenſive Paſſage to this occaſion: You exactly and peculiarly anſwer to thoſe profeſſing <hi>Jews,</hi> in that you bear the Name of God's People, by being the Children and wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Form of God's People: So that he by his <hi>Light</hi> in you, may be ſaid to come to his own, and if you obey it not, but turn your Back upon it, and walk after the <hi>Vanities</hi> of your <hi>Minds,</hi> you will be of thoſe that receive him not, which, I pray God, may never be your <hi>Caſe</hi> and <hi>Judgment;</hi> but that you may be throughly ſenſible of the many and great Obligations you lie under to the Lord for his <hi>Love,</hi> and your Parents for their <hi>Care:</hi> And with all your <hi>Heart</hi> and all your <hi>Soul,</hi> and all your <hi>Strength</hi> turn to the <hi>Lord,</hi> to his <hi>Gift</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> in you, and hear his <hi>Voice</hi> and obey it, that you may Seal to the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of your <hi>Fathers,</hi> by the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Evidence</hi> of your own <hi>Experience;</hi> that your <hi>Childrens Children</hi> may bleſs you, and the <hi>Lord</hi> for you, as thoſe that delivered a faithful <hi>Example,</hi> as well as <hi>Record</hi> of the <hi>Truth</hi> of <hi>God</hi> unto them. So will the <hi>Gray Hairs</hi> of your Dear <hi>Parents</hi> yet alive, go down to the <hi>Grave</hi> with <hi>Joy,</hi> to ſee you the poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Truth,</hi> as well as theirs, and that not only their Natures but Spirit ſhall live in you when they are gone.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude this <hi>Preface</hi> with a few Words to thoſe that are not of our <hi>Communion,</hi> into whoſe hands this may come, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially thoſe of our own <hi>Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friends,</hi> As you are the <hi>Sons</hi> and <hi>Daughters</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> and my Brethren after the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> often and earneſt have been my <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires</hi> and <hi>Prayers</hi> to God on your behalf, that you may come to know him that has Made you to be your <hi>Redeemer</hi> and <hi>Reſtorer</hi> to the <hi>Image</hi> that, through Sin, you have loſt, by the power and <hi>Spirit</hi> of his Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> whom he hath given for the <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> of the <hi>World.</hi> And Oh that you, who are called <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> would receive him into your Heart! for there it is you want him, and at that <hi>Door</hi> he ſtands knocking, that you ſhould let him in, but you do not open to him; You are full of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Gueſts,</hi> ſo that a Manger is his Lot among you Now, as well as of Old: Yet you are full of Profeſſion, as were the <hi>Jews</hi> when he came among them, who knew him not, but rejected and evilly intreated him. So that if you come not to the Poſſeſſion and Experience of what you profeſs, all your <hi>Formality</hi> in <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> will ſtand you in no ſtead in the Day of God's Judgment.</p>
            <p>I beſeech you ponder with your ſelves your <hi>Eternal Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and ſee what <hi>Title,</hi> what <hi>Ground</hi> and <hi>Foundation</hi> you have for your <hi>Chriſtianity:</hi> If more than a <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> and an Hiſtorical Belief of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> Have you known the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of <hi>Fire,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and the <hi>Fan</hi> of Chriſt that winnows away the Chaff; The <hi>Carnal Luſts</hi> and <hi>Affections?</hi> That Divine <hi>Leven</hi> of the Kingdom, that being received, <hi>Levens</hi> the whole Lump of
<pb facs="tcp:51448:34"/> Man, ſanctifying him throughout in <hi>Body, Soul</hi> and <hi>Spirit?</hi> If this be not the <hi>Ground</hi> of your Confidence, you are in a Miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Eſtate.</p>
            <p>You will ſay perhaps, that though you are <hi>Sinners,</hi> and live in the daily Commiſſion of <hi>Sin,</hi> and are not Santified, as I have been Speaking, yet you have Faith in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who has borne the Curſe for you, and in him you are Compleat by <hi>Faith;</hi> his <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi> being imputed to you.</p>
            <p>But my <hi>Friends,</hi> let me intreat you not to deceive your ſelves, in ſo Important a Point, as is that of your <hi>Immortal Souls.</hi> If you have true <hi>Faith</hi> in Chriſt, your <hi>Faith</hi> will make you Clean, it will Sanctifie you; for the <hi>Saints</hi> Faith was their <hi>Victory:</hi> By this they over came <hi>Sin within,</hi> and <hi>Sinful Men without.</hi> And if thou art in Chriſt thou walkeſt not after the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> but after the <hi>Spirit,</hi> whoſe Fruits are Manifeſt. Yea, thou art a <hi>New Creature, New Made, New Faſhioned</hi> after God's <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Mold:</hi> Old things are done away, and behold, all things are become <hi>New: New Love, Deſires, Will, Affections</hi> and <hi>Practices.</hi> It is not any longer <hi>Thou</hi> that liveſt, Thou <hi>Diſobedient, Carnal, World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> One; but it is <hi>Chriſt</hi> that liveth in thee, and to live is <hi>Chriſt</hi> and to die is thy <hi>Eternal Gain;</hi> becauſe thou art aſſured, <hi>That thy Corruptible ſhall put on Incorruption, and thy Mortal, Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;</hi> and that thou haſt a Glorious Houſe Eternal in the Heavens that will never wax Old or paſs away. All this follows being in Chriſt, as Heat follows Fire and Light the Sun.</p>
            <p>Therefore have a Care how you preſume to <hi>Rely</hi> upon ſuch a <hi>Notion,</hi> as that you are in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whilſt in your old fallen <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> For what <hi>Communion</hi> hath <hi>Light</hi> with <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> or Chriſt with <hi>Belial?</hi> Hear what the beloved Diſciple tells you: <hi>If we ſay we have fellowſhip with God, and walk in Darkneſs, we lie, and do not the Truth.</hi> That is, if we go on in a ſinful way, are Captivated by our <hi>Carnal Affections,</hi> and are not Converted to God, we walk in <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> and cannot poſſibly have any fellowſhip with <hi>God.</hi> Chriſt <hi>Cloths</hi> them with his <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> that receive his Grace in their Hearts, and deny themſelves, and take up his <hi>Croſs</hi> daily, and follow him. Chriſt's <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> makes Men inwardly <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> of Holy Minds, Wills and Practices. It is nevertheleſs Chriſts, becauſe we have it; for it is ours, not by <hi>Nature,</hi> but by <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Adoption:</hi> It is the Gift of <hi>God:</hi> But ſtill tho' not ours, as of or from our ſelves, for in that Senſe it is Chriſt's, for it is of and from him, yet it is ours; and muſt be ours in <hi>Poſſeſſion, Efficacy</hi> and <hi>Enjoyment</hi> to do us any <hi>Good,</hi> or Chriſt's <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit us nothing. It was after this manner, That he was made to the primitive Chriſtians, <hi>Righteouſneſs, Sanctification, Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> and <hi>Redemption;</hi> and if ever you will have the <hi>Comfort, Kernel</hi> and <hi>Marrow</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> thus you muſt come to learn and obtain it.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:51448:34"/>
            <p>Now, my <hi>Friends,</hi> by what you have Read, and will Read in what Follows, you may perceive, that God has viſited a <hi>Poor People</hi> among you with this ſaving <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Teſtimony;</hi> whom he has upheld and encreaſed to this Day, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fierce oppoſition they have met withal. Deſpiſe not the meanneſs of this <hi>Appearance:</hi> It was, and yet is (we know) a day of ſmall things, and of ſmall Account with too many; and many hard and ill Names are given to it; but it is of God, it came from him becauſe it leads to him. This we know, but we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make another know it, as we know it, unleſs he will take the ſame way to know it, that we took. The World talks of God; but what do they do? They pray for <hi>Power,</hi> but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the Principle in which it is. If you would know God and Worſhip and ſerve God, as you ſhould do, you muſt come to the means he has ordained and given for that purpoſe. Some ſeek it in <hi>Books,</hi> ſome in <hi>Learned Men,</hi> but what they look for, is in themſelves, but they overlook it. The <hi>Voice</hi> is too ſtill, the <hi>Seed</hi> too ſmall, and the <hi>Light</hi> ſhineth in <hi>Darkneſs.</hi> They are abroad, and ſo cannot divide the <hi>Spoil;</hi> but the <hi>Woman,</hi> that loſt her <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> found it at <hi>Home,</hi> after ſhe had light her Candle and ſwept her Houſe. Do you ſo too, and you ſhall find what <hi>Pilate</hi> wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to know, <hi>viz. Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The light of Chriſt within, who is the Light of the World, (and ſo a Light to you, that tells you the Truth of your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition) leads all, that take heed unto it, out of <hi>Darkneſs</hi> into God's marvellous <hi>Light;</hi> for <hi>Light</hi> grows upon the <hi>Obedient.</hi> It is ſown for the <hi>Righteous,</hi> and their way is a ſhining <hi>Light,</hi> that ſhines forth more and more to the perfect day.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, O <hi>Friends,</hi> Turn in, Turn in, I beſeech you! Where is the <hi>Poiſon,</hi> there is the <hi>Antidote:</hi> There you want Chriſt, and there you muſt find him; and bleſſed be God, there you may find him. <hi>Seek and you ſhall find,</hi> I teſtifie for God: But then you muſt ſeek aright, with your whole <hi>Heart,</hi> as Men that ſeek for their <hi>Lives,</hi> yea, for their <hi>Eternal Lives:</hi> Diligently, Humbly, Patiently, as thoſe that can taſte no Pleaſure, Comfort or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in any thing elſe, unleſs you find him whom your <hi>Souls</hi> want, and deſire to know and love above all. O it is a <hi>Travail,</hi> a Spiritual <hi>Travail!</hi> Let the Carnal, Profane World think and ſay as it will. And through this Path you muſt walk to the City of God, that has Eternal <hi>Foundations,</hi> if ever you will come there.</p>
            <p>Well! And what does this bleſſed <hi>Light</hi> do for you? Why, 1. it ſets all your ſins in order before you: It detects the Spirit of this World in all its <hi>Bates</hi> and <hi>Allurements,</hi> and ſhews how Man came to fall from God, and the fallen Eſtate he is in. 2. It begets a Senſe and Sorrow, in ſuch as believe in it, for this fearful Laps. You will then ſee him Diſtinctly, whom you have <hi>Pierced</hi> him, and all the <hi>Blows</hi> and <hi>Wounds</hi> you have given him by your <hi>Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:51448:35"/> and how you have made him to ſerve with your Sins, and you will <hi>Weep</hi> and <hi>Mourn</hi> for it, and your <hi>Sorrow</hi> will be a <hi>Godly Sorrow.</hi> 3. After this it will bring you to the Holy <hi>Watch,</hi> to take <hi>Care</hi> that you do ſo no more, that the Enemy ſurpriſe you not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: Then <hi>Thoughts,</hi> as well as <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Works,</hi> will come to <hi>Judgment,</hi> which is the way of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> in which the <hi>Redeemed</hi> of the Lord do Walk. Here you will come to love God above all, and your Neighbours as your ſelves. Nothing <hi>Hurts,</hi> No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hing <hi>Harms,</hi> Nothing makes <hi>Afraid</hi> on this <hi>Holy Mountain:</hi> Now you come to be Chriſt's indeed, for you are his in <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> and not your own. And when you are thus Chriſt's, then Chriſt is yours, and not before: And here <hi>Communion</hi> with the <hi>Father</hi> and with the <hi>Son</hi> you will know, and the Efficacy of the <hi>Blood</hi> of Cleanſing, even the <hi>Blood</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, that <hi>Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate Lamb,</hi> which ſpeaketh better things than the <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi> and which cleanſeth from all Sin the <hi>Conſciences</hi> of thoſe that, through the living Faith, come to be ſprinkled with it from dead Works to ſerve the living God.</p>
            <p>To Conclude, Behold the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> and <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the People called <hi>Quakers!</hi> Behold their <hi>Practice</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline!</hi> And behold the bleſſed <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Men</hi> that were ſent of God in this Excellent <hi>Work</hi> and <hi>Service!</hi> All which will be more particularly expreſſed in the Enſuing <hi>Annals</hi> of the Man of God; which I do heartily recommend to my <hi>Readers</hi> moſt ſerious Peruſal, and beſeech Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, that his Bleſſing may go along with it, to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing of many, as yet Strangers to this <hi>Holy Diſpenſation,</hi> and alſo to the Edification of the Church of God in General: Who, for his manifold and repeated Mercies and Bleſſings to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in this day of his great Love, is worthy ever to have the <hi>Glory, Honour, Thanksgiving</hi> and <hi>Renown;</hi> and be it rendred and aſcribed, with Fear and Reverence, through him in whom he is well pleaſed, his bloved <hi>Son</hi> and <hi>Lamb,</hi> our <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> that fits with him upon the Throne, World without End. <hi>Amen,</hi>
               <q>Says One that God has long ſince Mercifully favoured with his <hi>Fatherly Viſitation,</hi> and who was not Diſobedient to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Viſion and Call, to whom the Way of Truth is more <hi>Lovely</hi> and <hi>Precious</hi> than ever, and that knowing the Beauty and Benefit of it above all Worldly Treaſure, has choſen it for his <hi>Chiefeſt Joy,</hi> and therefore recommends it to thy Love and Choice, becauſe he is with great Sincerity and Affection thy Souls Friend.</q>

The Neighbours called him <hi>Righteous Chriſter.</hi> My Mother was an upright Woman; her Maiden-name was <hi>Mary Lago,</hi> of the Family of the <hi>Lago</hi>'s, and of the Stock of the <hi>Martyrs.</hi>

            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:51448:36"/>
            <p>In my very <hi>Young Years,</hi> I had a Gravity and ſtayedneſs of Mind and Spirit, not uſual in <hi>Children;</hi> inſomuch, that when I have ſeen <hi>Old Men</hi> carry themſelves lightly and wantonly towards each other, I have had a Diſlike thereof riſen in my Heart, and have ſaid within my ſelf; <hi>If ever I come to be a Man, ſurely, I ſhould not do ſo, nor be ſo wanton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When I came to <hi>Eleven Years</hi> of <hi>Age,</hi> I knew <hi>Pureneſs</hi> and <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs:</hi> For while I was a <hi>Child,</hi> I was taught how to walk to be kept <hi>pure.</hi> The <hi>Lord</hi> taught me to be <hi>faithful</hi> in all Things, and to act <hi>faithfully</hi> two ways; <hi>viz. Inwardly</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Outwardly</hi> to <hi>Man;</hi> and to keep to <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Nay</hi> in all Things. For the <hi>Lord</hi> ſhewed me, that though the People of the World have Mouths full of <hi>Deceit,</hi> and changeable Words, yet I was to keep to <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Nay</hi> in all Things; and that my Words ſhould be few and ſavory, ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with Grace: And that I might not <hi>Eat</hi> and <hi>Drink</hi> to make my ſelf Wanton, but for <hi>Health;</hi> uſing the Creatures in their Service, as Servants in their Places, to the Glory of him that harh created them: they being in their <hi>Covenant,</hi> and I being brought up into the <hi>Covenant,</hi> as ſanctified by the <hi>Word,</hi> which was in the Beginning, by which all things are upheld; wherein is <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> with the <hi>Creation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But People, being Strangers to the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> with God, they <hi>Eat</hi> and <hi>Drink</hi> to make themſelves wanton with the <hi>Creatures,</hi> devouring them upon their own Luſts, and living in all Filthineſs, loving foul ways, and devouring the <hi>Creation;</hi> and all this in the World, in the <hi>Pollutions</hi> thereof without God: And <hi>therefore I was to ſhun all ſuch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Afterwards, as I grew up, my <hi>Relations</hi> thought to have made me a <hi>Prieſt;</hi> but others perſwaded to the Contrary. Whereupon I was put to a Man, that was a <hi>Shoo-maker</hi> by Trade, and that dealt in <hi>Wooll</hi> and uſed <hi>Grazing,</hi> and ſold <hi>Cattel;</hi> and a great deal went through my Hands. While I was with him, he was <hi>bleſt:</hi> But after I left him, he <hi>broke,</hi> and came to nothing. I never <hi>wronged</hi> Man or Woman in all that Time: For the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> was with me, and over me, to preſerve me. While I was in that Service, I uſed in my Dealings the Word <hi>[Verily,]</hi> and it was a common Saying among People, that knew me, <hi>If</hi> George <hi>ſays</hi> verily, <hi>there is no altering him.</hi> When <hi>Boys</hi> and <hi>rude People</hi> would laugh at me, I let them alone, and went my Way: But People had generally a <hi>Love</hi> to me, for my <hi>Innocency</hi> and <hi>Honeſty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When I came towards <hi>Nineteen Years</hi> of <hi>Age,</hi> I being upon Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs at a <hi>Fair,</hi> one of my Couſins, whoſe Name was <hi>Bradford,</hi> (being a <hi>Profeſſor,</hi> and having another <hi>Profeſſor</hi> with him) came to me, and asked me to <hi>drink</hi> part of a Jug of Beer with them; and I, being Thirſty, went in with them: For I loved any, that had a <hi>Senſe</hi> of <hi>Good,</hi> or that did ſeek after the <hi>Lord.</hi> And when we had drunk a <hi>Glaſs</hi> a piece, they began to drink <hi>Healths,</hi> and called for more Drink; agreeing together, That he that would not drink, ſhould pay all. I was grieved, that any, that made <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> ſhould offer to do ſo. They grieved me very much, having never had ſuch a thing put to me before, by any ſort of People.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51448:36"/> Wherefore I roſe up to be gone; and putting my Hand into my Pocket, I took out a <hi>Groat,</hi> and laid it down upon the Table before them, and ſaid, <hi>If it be ſo, I'll leave you.</hi> So I went away: And when I had done, what Buſineſs I had to do, I returned home: But did not go to Bed that Night, nor could not <hi>Sleep;</hi> but ſometimes walked up and down, and ſometimes <hi>prayed,</hi> and <hi>cryed</hi> to the <hi>Lord,</hi> who ſaid unto me; <hi>Thou ſeest,</hi>

            <p>Then at the Command of God, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1643"/> on the <hi>Ninth Day</hi> of the <hi>Seventh Month,</hi> 1643. I left my <hi>Relations,</hi>

And as I thus travelled through the Countries, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1644"/> 
               <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors</hi> took notice of me, and ſought to be acquainted with me; but I was afraid of them: For I was ſenſible, they did not <hi>Poſſeſs,</hi> what they <hi>Profeſs'd.</hi> Now during the time, that I was at <hi>Barnet,</hi> a ſtrong <hi>Temptation</hi> to <hi>Deſpair</hi> came upon me: and then I ſaw, how Chriſt was <hi>Tempted;</hi> and mighty <hi>Troubles</hi> I was in. And ſometimes I kept my ſelf retired in my Chamber, and often walked ſolitary in the <hi>Chace</hi> there, to <hi>Wait</hi> upon the <hi>Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I wondered, why theſe Things ſhould come to me, and I looked upon my ſelf, and ſaid, <hi>Was I ever ſo before?</hi> Then I thought, becauſe I had forſaken my <hi>Relations,</hi> I had done amiſs againſt them. So I was brought to call to Mind all my Time, that I had ſpent, and to conſider, whether I had <hi>wrong'd</hi> any? But <hi>Temptations</hi> grew more and more, and I was tempted <hi>almost to Deſpair.</hi> And when <hi>Satan</hi> could not effect his Deſign upon me that way, then he laid <hi>Snares</hi> for me, and <hi>Baits</hi> to draw me to commit ſome <hi>Sin,</hi> whereby he might take advantage to bring me to <hi>Deſpair.</hi> I was about <hi>Twenty Years</hi> of <hi>Age,</hi> when theſe Exerciſes came upon me; and ſome Years I continued in that Condition, in great <hi>Troubles;</hi> and fain I would have put it from me. And I went to many a <hi>Prieſt</hi> to look for <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,</hi> but found no <hi>Comfort</hi> from them.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Barnet</hi> I went to <hi>London,</hi> where I took a Lodging,<note place="margin">London.</note> and was under great Miſery and Trouble there: For I looked upon the great <hi>Profeſſors</hi> of the City of <hi>London,</hi> and I ſaw all was <hi>dark,</hi> and under the Chain of <hi>Darkneſs.</hi> And I had an Uncle there, one <hi>Pickering,</hi> a <hi>Baptiſt</hi> (and they were tender then:) Yet I could not impart my Mind to him, nor join with them: For I ſaw all, <hi>Young</hi> and <hi>Old,</hi> where they were. Some tender People would have had me ſtayed, but I was fearful, and returned homewards in <hi>Leiceſterſhire</hi> again,<note place="margin">Leiceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</note> having a Regard upon my Mind unto my <hi>Parents</hi> and <hi>Relations,</hi> leſt I ſhould grieve them, who, I underſtood, were troubled at my Abſence.</p>
            <p>When I was come down into <hi>Leiceſterſhire,</hi> my <hi>Relations</hi> would have had me Married: But I told them, I was but a <hi>Lad,</hi> and I muſt get <hi>Wiſdom.</hi> Others would have had me into the <hi>Auxiliary Band,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:51448:37"/> among the <hi>Soldiery;</hi>

               <note place="margin">Coventry.</note> but I refuſed: and I was grieved, that they proffered ſuch Things to me, being a tender <hi>Youth.</hi> Then I went to <hi>Coventry,</hi> where I took a Chamber for a while at a <hi>Profeſſor's</hi> Houſe, till People began to be acquainted with me; for there were many tender People in that Town. And after ſome time, I went into my own Country again,<note place="margin">Leiceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</note> and was there about a Year, in great <hi>Sorrows</hi> and <hi>Troubles,</hi> and walked many Nights by my ſelf.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1645"/> Then the <hi>Prieſt</hi> of <hi>Drayton</hi> (the Town of my <hi>Birth</hi>) whoſe Name was <hi>Nathaniel Stevens,</hi> would come often to me, and I went often to him; and another <hi>Prieſt</hi> ſometimes would come with him: And they would have given place to me, to hear me; and I would ask them Queſtions, and reaſon with them. And this <hi>Prieſt Stevens</hi> asked me a Queſtion, <hi>viz. Why Chriſt cryed out upon the Croſs, My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> And <hi>why he ſaid, If it be poſſible, let this Cup paſs from me; yet not my Will, but thine be done?</hi> And I told him; At that time, the <hi>Sins</hi> of all Mankind were upon him, and their <hi>Iniquities</hi> and <hi>Tranſgreſſions,</hi> with which he was wounded; which he was to bear, and to be an <hi>Offering</hi> for them, as he was <hi>Man,</hi> but died not, as he was <hi>God.</hi> And ſo, in that he <hi>died</hi> for all Men, and taſted Death for every Man, he was an <hi>Offering</hi> for the <hi>Sins</hi> of the whole World. (This I ſpake, being at that time in a meaſure ſenſible of <hi>Chriſt's Sufferings,</hi> and what he went through.) And the <hi>Prieſt</hi> ſaid, <hi>It was a very good, full Anſwer; and ſuch an one, as he had not heard.</hi> And at that time, he would applaud and ſpeak highly of me to others: And what I ſaid in Diſcourſe to him on the <hi>Week-days,</hi> that he would Preach of on the <hi>Firſt-days;</hi> for which I did not like him. And this <hi>Prieſt</hi> afterwards became my great <hi>Perſecutor.</hi>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Manſetter <hi>in</hi> War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick-ſhire.</note>After this, I went to another Ancient <hi>Prieſt</hi> at <hi>Manſetter</hi> in <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick-ſhire,</hi> and reaſoned with him about the Ground of <hi>Deſpair</hi> and <hi>Temptations;</hi> but he was ignorant of my Condition: And he bid me <hi>Take Tobacco,</hi> and <hi>Sing Pſalms. Tobacco</hi> was a thing I did not love; and <hi>Pſalms</hi> I was not in an Eſtate to <hi>Sing:</hi> I could not <hi>Sing.</hi> Then he bid me come again, and he would tell me many Things. But when I came again, he was angry and pettiſh: For my former Words had diſpleaſed him. And he told my <hi>Troubles,</hi> and <hi>Sorrows</hi> and <hi>Griefs</hi> to his Servants, ſo that it was got among the <hi>Milk-Laſſes;</hi> which grieved me, that I ſhould open my Mind to ſuch an one. I ſaw, they were all <hi>Miſerable Comforters:</hi> And this brought my <hi>Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi> more upon me.<note place="margin">Tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth.</note> Then I heard of a <hi>Prieſt</hi> living about <hi>Tamworth,</hi> who was accounted an <hi>Experienced Man;</hi> and I went <hi>Seven Miles</hi> to him: But I found him but like an <hi>Empty, hollow Cask.</hi> Then I heard of one called <hi>Doctor Cradock</hi> of <hi>Coventry;</hi> and I went to him, and I asked him the Ground of <hi>Temptations</hi> and <hi>Deſpair;</hi> and how <hi>Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi> came to be wrought in Man? He asked me, <hi>Who was Chriſt's Father and Mother?</hi> I told him, <hi>Mary</hi> was his Mother, and that he was ſuppoſed to be the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Joſeph;</hi> but he was the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> Now as we were walking together in his <hi>Garden,</hi> the <hi>Ally</hi> being nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, I chanced, in turning, to ſet my Foot on the ſide of a <hi>Bed;</hi> at which the Man was in ſuch a Rage, as if his Houſe had been on Fire. And thus all our Diſcourſe was loſt, and I went away in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51448:37"/> Sorrow, worſe than I was, when I came. I thought them <hi>Miſerable Comforters:</hi> And I ſaw, they were all as Nothing to me; for they could not reach my Condition. After this I went to another, one <hi>Macham,</hi> a <hi>Prieſt</hi> in high Account: And he would needs give me ſome <hi>Phyſick,</hi> and I was to have been let <hi>Blood:</hi> But they could not get one <hi>drop</hi> of <hi>Blood</hi> from me, either in <hi>Arms</hi> or <hi>Head</hi> (though they endeavoured it) my Body being, as it were, dried up with <hi>Sorrows, Grief</hi> and <hi>Troubles,</hi> which were ſo great upon me, that I could have wiſhed, I had never been born to ſee Vanity and Wickedneſs; or that I had been born <hi>Blind,</hi> that I might never have ſeen <hi>Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> nor <hi>Vanity;</hi> and <hi>Deaf,</hi> that I might never have heard <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>wicked Words,</hi> or the Lord's Name blaſphemed. And when the time, called <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> came, while others were Feaſting and Sport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves, I would have gone, and looked out <hi>poor Widows</hi> from Houſe to Houſe, and have given them ſome Money. And when I was invited to <hi>Marriages</hi> (as I ſometimes was) I would go to none at all; but the <hi>next</hi> day or ſoon after I would go, and viſit them: And if they were <hi>Poor,</hi> I gave them ſome Money; for I had, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with both to keep my ſelf from being Chargeable to others, and to adminiſter ſomething to the <hi>Neceſſities</hi> of Others.</p>
            <p>About the beginning of the Year, 1646. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1646"/> as I was going to <hi>Coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> and entring towards the Gate, a Conſideration aroſe in me, how it was ſaid, That <hi>All Chriſtians are Believers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Coventry.</note> both <hi>Proteſtants</hi> and <hi>Papiſts.</hi> And the <hi>Lord</hi> opened to me, that if all were <hi>Believers,</hi> then they were all <hi>born of God,</hi> and paſſed from Death to Life; and that none were true <hi>Believers,</hi> but ſuch: And though Others ſaid, they were <hi>Believers,</hi> yet they were not. At another time, as I was walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a Field on a <hi>Firſt-day</hi> Morning, the Lord opened unto me, <q>That being bred at <hi>Oxford</hi> or <hi>Cambridge,</hi> was not enough to fit and qualifie Men to be Miniſters of Chriſt:</q> And I ſtranged at it, becauſe it was the common Belief of People. But I ſaw it clearly, as the <hi>Lord</hi> opened it to me, and was ſatisfied; and admired the Goodneſs of the Lord, who had opened this thing unto me that Morning: Which ſtruck at <hi>Prieſt Stevens</hi> his <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> namely, that <hi>To be bred at</hi> Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford <hi>or</hi> Cambridge, <hi>was not enough to make a Man fit to be a Miniſter of Chriſt.</hi> So that which opened in me, I ſaw, ſtruck at the <hi>Prieſt's Miniſtry.</hi> But my <hi>Relations</hi> were much troubled at me, that I would not go with them to hear the <hi>Prieſt:</hi> For I would get into the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard, or the Fields, with my <hi>Bible,</hi> by my ſelf. And I told them, did not the Apoſtle ſay to <hi>Believers,</hi> That they needed no Man to <hi>teach</hi> them, but as the <hi>Anointing teacheth</hi> them? And though they knew, this was Scripture, and that it was true; yet they would be grieved, becauſe I could not be ſubject in this Matter, to go to <hi>hear the Prieſt</hi> with them: For I ſaw, that a true <hi>Believer</hi> was another thing, than they looked upon it to be. And I ſaw, that being bred at <hi>Oxford</hi> or <hi>Cambridge,</hi> did not qualifie or fit a Man to be a <hi>Miniſter</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and what then ſhould I follow ſuch for? So neither them, nor any of the <hi>Diſſenting People,</hi> could I join with; but was as a <hi>Stranger</hi> to all, relying wholly upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:51448:38"/>
            <p>At another time it was opened in me, <q>That God, who made the World, did not dwell in Temples made with Hands.</q> This, at the firſt, ſeemed a ſtrange Word, becauſe both <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>People</hi> uſe to call their <hi>Temples</hi> or <hi>Churches, dreadful Places,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ground,</hi> and the <hi>Temples</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> But the Lord ſhewed me, ſo that I did ſee clearly, that he did not dwell in theſe <hi>Temples,</hi> which Men had commanded and ſet up; but in <hi>People's Hearts.</hi> For both <hi>Stephen</hi> and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> bore Teſtimony, That he did not dwell in <hi>Temples made with Hands;</hi> not even in that, which he had once commanded to be built; ſince he put an End to it: But that his <hi>People</hi> were his <hi>Temple;</hi> and he dwelt in them. This opened in me, as I walked in the Fields to my <hi>Relations</hi> Houſe. And when I came there, they told me, That <hi>Nath Stevens,</hi> the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> had been there, and told them, He was afraid of me, for going after <hi>New Lights.</hi> And I ſmiled in my ſelf, knowing, what the <hi>Lord</hi> had opened in me concerning him and his Brethren: But I told not my <hi>Relations;</hi> who though they ſaw beyond the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> yet they went to hear them, and were griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe I would not go alſo. But I brought them <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and told them, There was an <hi>Anointing</hi> within Man, to <hi>teach</hi> him; and that the <hi>Lord</hi> would <hi>teach</hi> his People himſelf. And I had great <hi>Open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> concerning the <hi>Things</hi> written in the <hi>Revelations;</hi> and when I ſpake of them, the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Profeſſors</hi> would ſay, That was a <hi>ſealed up Book;</hi> and would have kept me out of it. But I told them, Chriſt could open the <hi>Seals;</hi> and that they were the neareſt things to us: For the <hi>Epiſtles</hi> were written to the Saints, that lived in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages; but the <hi>Revelations</hi> were written of things to come.</p>
            <p>After this I met with a ſort of <hi>People,</hi> that held, <hi>Women have no Souls;</hi> (adding in a light manner) <hi>no more than a Gooſe.</hi> But I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved them, and told them, that was not right: For <hi>Mary</hi> ſaid, <hi>My</hi> Soul <hi>doth magnify the</hi> Lord, <hi>and my</hi> Spirit <hi>hath rejoyced in</hi> God <hi>my</hi> Saviour.</p>
            <p>And removing again to another Place, I came among a <hi>People,</hi> that relied much on <hi>Dreams.</hi> And I told them; Except they could diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between <hi>Dream</hi> and <hi>Dream,</hi> they would maſh or confound al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together: For there were <hi>Three</hi> ſorts of <hi>Dreams;</hi> for <hi>Multitude</hi> of <hi>Buſineſs</hi> ſometimes cauſed <hi>Dreams:</hi> And there were <hi>Whiſperings</hi> of <hi>Satan</hi> in Man in the Night-Seaſon; and there were <hi>Speakings</hi> of <hi>God</hi> to <hi>Man</hi> in <hi>Dreams.</hi> But theſe People came out of theſe Things, and at laſt became <hi>Friends.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now though I had great <hi>Openings,</hi> yet great <hi>Trouble</hi> and <hi>Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> came many Times upon me; ſo that when it was Day, I wiſhed for Night, and when it was Night, I wiſhed for Day.

               </gap> my <hi>Troubles</hi> continued, and I was often under great Temptations; and I <hi>faſted</hi> much, and walked abroad in ſolitary Places many Days, and often took my <hi>Bible,</hi> and went and ſate in hollow Trees, and loneſome Places, till Night came on; and frequently, in the Night, walked mournfully about by my ſelf: For I was a <hi>Man</hi> of <hi>Sorrows</hi> in the Times of the <hi>firſt Workings</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> in me.</p>
            <p>Now, during all this Time I was never joined in <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> with any, but gave up my ſelf to the <hi>Lord;</hi> having forſaken all evil Company, and taken leave of <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Mother,</hi> and all other <hi>Relations,</hi> and travelled up and down as a Stranger in the Earth, which Way the Lord inclined my Heart; taking a Chamber to my ſelf in Town, where I came, and tarrying ſometimes a <hi>Month,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more, ſometimes leſs in a Place: For I durſt not ſtay long in any Place, being afraid both of <hi>Profeſſor</hi> and <hi>Profane,</hi> leſt, being a tender Young-Man, I ſhould be hurt by converſing much with either. For which Reaſon I kept my ſelf much as a <hi>Stranger,</hi> ſeeking hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Wiſdom, and getting Knowledge from the <hi>Lord;</hi> and was brought off from outward Things, to rely wholly on the <hi>Lord</hi> alone. And though my <hi>Exerciſes</hi> and <hi>Troubles</hi> were very great, yet were they not ſo continual, but that I had ſome Intermiſſions; and was ſometimes brought into ſuch an <hi>Heavenly Joy,</hi> that I thought, I had been in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom. As I cannot declare the <hi>Miſery</hi> I was in, it was ſo great and heavy upon upon me; ſo neither can I ſet forth the <hi>Mercies</hi> of <hi>God</hi> unto me in all my <hi>Miſery.</hi> Oh! the everlaſting <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>God</hi> to my <hi>Soul,</hi> when I was in great <hi>Diſtreſs!</hi> when my <q>Troubles <hi>and</hi> Torments <hi>were great, then was his</hi> Love <hi>exceeding great.</hi> Thou, <hi>Lord,</hi> makeſt a fruitful Field a barren Wilderneſs, and a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Wilderneſs a fruitful Field! thou bringeſt down and ſetteſt up! Thou killeſt and makeſt alive! all Honour and Glory be to thee, O <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Glory!</hi> The Knowledge of thee in the Spirit is Life: But that Knowledge which is fleſhly, works Death.</q> And while there is this <hi>Knowledge</hi> in the <hi>Fleſh, Deceit</hi> and <hi>Self</hi> will conform to any thing, and will ſay <hi>Yes, yes,</hi> to that it doth not know. The <hi>Knowledge</hi> which the World hath, of what the Prophets and Apoſtles ſpake, is a <hi>fleſhly Knowledge;</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtates</hi> from the <hi>Life,</hi> in which the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were, have gotten their Words, the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> in a <hi>Form,</hi> but not in their <hi>Life,</hi> nor <hi>Spirit,</hi> that gave them forth.

            <p>Now after I had received that <hi>Opening</hi> from the Lord, that <hi>To be bred at</hi> Oxford <hi>or</hi> Cambridge, <hi>was not ſufficient to fit a Man to be a Miniſter of Chriſt,</hi> I regarded the <hi>Prieſts</hi> leſs, and looked more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Diſſenting People.</hi> And among them I ſaw, there was ſome Tenderneſs: And many of them came afterwards to be <hi>Convinced;</hi> for they had ſome <hi>Openings.</hi> But as I had forſaken all the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> ſo I left the <hi>Separate Preachers</hi> alſo, and thoſe called the <hi>Moſt-Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced People:</hi> For I ſaw, there was none among them all, that could ſpeak to my <hi>Condition.</hi> And when all my hopes in them, and in all Men was gone, ſo that I had nothing outwardly to help me, nor could tell what to do; Then, O! then I heard a Voice, which ſaid,<note place="margin">☞</note> "<hi>There is one, even Chriſt Jeſus, that can ſpeak to thy Condition:</hi> And when I heard it, my Heart did leap for Joy.

                  </gap>.</hi> Thus when God doth work, who ſhall let it? And this I knew experimentally. My Deſires after the Lord grew ſtronger, and Zeal in the pure know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, and of Chriſt alone, without the help of any <hi>Man, Book</hi> or <hi>Writing.</hi> For though I read the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> that ſpake of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and of <hi>God;</hi> yet I knew him not, but by <hi>Revelation,</hi> as he, who hath the <hi>Key,</hi> did open, and as the <hi>Father</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> drew me to his <hi>Son</hi> by his Spirit. And then the Lord did gently lead me along, and did let me ſee his <hi>Love,</hi> which was Endleſs and Eternal, and ſurpaſſeth all the <hi>Knowledge,</hi> that Men have in the natural State, or can get by <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> or <hi>Books.</hi> And that <hi>Love</hi> did let me ſee my ſelf, as I was without him; and I was afraid of all Company: For I ſaw them perfectly, where they were, through the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which let me ſee my ſelf. And I had not Fellowſhip with any <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Prieſts</hi> nor <hi>Profeſſors,</hi> nor any ſort of <hi>ſeparated People;</hi> but with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who hath the <hi>Key,</hi> and opened the Door of <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me. And I was afraid of all <hi>Carnal Talk</hi> and <hi>Talkers;</hi> for I could ſee nothing but Corruptions, and the Life lay under the Burden of Corruptions. And when I my ſelf was in the <hi>Deep,</hi> under all ſhut up, I could not believe, that I ſhould ever <hi>Overcome;</hi> my <hi>Troubles,</hi> my <hi>Sorrows</hi> and my <hi>Temptations</hi> were ſo great, that I thought many times, I ſhould have deſpaired, I was ſo tempted. But when Chriſt opened to me, how he was tempted by the ſame <hi>Devil,</hi> and had <hi>Overcome</hi> him, and bruiſed his Head; and that through him and his Power, Light, Grace and Spirit, I ſhould <hi>Overcome</hi> alſo; I had Confidence in him. So he it was, that opened to me, when I was ſhut up, and had not hope, nor Faith. Chriſt it was (who had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened me) that gave me his <hi>Light</hi> to believe in, and gave me <hi>Hope,</hi> which is himſelf, <hi>Revealed</hi> himſelf in me, and gave me his <hi>Spirit,</hi> and gave me his <hi>Grace,</hi> which I found ſufficient in the Deeps and in Weakneſs. Thus in the deepeſt <hi>Miſeries,</hi> and in the greateſt <hi>Sorrows</hi> and <hi>Temptations,</hi> that many times beſet me, the <hi>Lord</hi> in his Mercy did keep me. And I found, that there were <hi>Two Thirſts</hi> in me; the one after the <hi>Creatures,</hi> to have gotten Help and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51448:39" rendition="simple:additions"/> Strength there; and the other after the <hi>Lord,</hi> the <hi>Creator,</hi> and his <hi>Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And I ſaw, all the World could do me no good. If I had had a <hi>King's Diet, Palace</hi> and <hi>Attendance,</hi> all would have been as nothing: For nothing gave me Comfort, but the Lord by his Power. And I ſaw <hi>Profeſſors, Prieſts</hi> and <hi>People</hi> were whole and at eaſe in that Condition, which was my <hi>Miſery;</hi> and they loved that, which I would have been rid of. But the Lord did ſtay my Deſires upon himſelf, from whom my help came, and my care was caſt upon him alone. Therefore all <hi>Wait</hi> patiently upon the <hi>Lord,</hi> whatſoever Condition you be in; wait in the <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> that comes by <hi>Jeſus:</hi> For if ye ſo do, there is a Promiſe to you, and the Lord God will fulfil it in you. And <hi>Bleſſed are all they</hi> indeed, <hi>that</hi> do indeed <hi>hunger and thirſt after Righteouſneſs;</hi> they ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with it: I have found it ſo, praiſed be the <hi>Lord,</hi> who filleth with it, and ſatisfieth the deſires of the hungry Soul. O let the Houſe of the Spiritual <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſay, <hi>His Mercy endureth for ever!</hi> It is the great Love of God, to make a <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> of that, which is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to the outward Eye and fleſhly Mind; and to make a <hi>fruitful Field</hi> of a <hi>barren Wilderneſs:</hi> This is the great Work of God. But while People's Minds do run in the Earthly, after the Creatures, and changeable Things, and changeable Ways and Religions, and changeable, uncertain Teachers, their Minds are in Bondage, and they are brittle and changeable, and toſſed up and down with windy Doctrines and Thoughts, and Notions and Things; their Minds being from the unchangeable <hi>Truth</hi> in the inward Parts, the <hi>Light</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, which would keep their Minds to the Unchangeable, who is the Way to the Father; who in all my <hi>Troubles</hi> did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve me by his <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> praiſed be his Holy Name for ever!</p>
            <p>Again I heard a <hi>Voice,</hi> which did ſay, <q>Thou Serpent! Thou doſt ſeek to deſtroy the Life; but canſt not: For the Sword, which keepeth the Tree of Life, ſhall deſtroy thee.</q> So <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> that bruiſed the <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Serpent,</hi> the Deſtroyer, preſerved me; my inward Mind being joined to his good Seed, that bruiſed the <hi>Head</hi> of this <hi>Serpent,</hi> the Deſtroyer. And this inward <hi>Life</hi> did ſpring up in me, to anſwer all the Oppoſing <hi>Profeſſors</hi> and <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and did bring in Scriptures to my Memory to refute them with.</p>
            <p>At another time I ſaw the great <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> and I was filled with admiration at the <hi>Infiniteneſs</hi> of it. And then I ſaw, what was <hi>Caſt out</hi> from God; and what <hi>Entred</hi> into God's Kingdom: And how by <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the <hi>Opener</hi> of the Door by his Heavenly <hi>Key,</hi> the Entrance was given. And I ſaw <hi>Death,</hi> how it had paſſed upon all Men, and oppreſſed the <hi>Seed</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in Man, and in me: And how I in the <hi>Seed</hi> came forth; and what the Promiſe was to. Yet it was ſo with me, that there ſeemed to be <hi>Two Pleading</hi> in me; and Queſtionings aroſe in my Mind about <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Prophecies:</hi> and I was tempted again to <hi>Deſpair,</hi> as if I had ſinned againſt the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And I was in great Perplexity and Trouble for many Days; Yet I gave up my ſelf to the <hi>Lord</hi> ſtill. And one day, when I had been walking ſolitarily abroad, and was come home, I was taken up in the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> ſo that I could not but admire the greatneſs of his <hi>Love:</hi> And while I
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51448:40"/> was in that Condition, it was opened unto me by the Eternal <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> and I therein clearly ſaw, <q>That all was done, and to be done in and by Chriſt; and how he conquers and deſtroys this Tempter, the <hi>Devil,</hi> and all his Works, and is a top of him; And that all theſe Troubles were good for me, and Temptations for the Trial of my Faith, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> had given me.</q> And the <hi>Lord</hi> opened me, that I ſaw through all theſe <hi>Troubles</hi> and <hi>Temptations:</hi> My living Faith was raiſed, that I ſaw, <hi>All was done by Chriſt, the Life,</hi> and my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief was in him. And when at any time my Condition was vailed, my ſecret <hi>Belief</hi> was ſtayed firm, and <hi>Hope</hi> underneath held me, as an <hi>Anchor</hi> in the bottom of the Sea, and Anchored my Immortal Soul to its Biſhop, cauſing it to ſwim above the <hi>Sea,</hi> the <hi>World,</hi> where all the raging Waves, foul Weather, Tempeſts and Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations are. But oh! then did I ſee my <hi>Troubles, Trials</hi> and <hi>Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi> more than ever I had done. As the <hi>Light</hi> appeared, all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, that is out of the Light, <hi>Darkneſs, Death, Temptations,</hi> the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteous,</hi> the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly;</hi> all was manifeſt and ſeen in the <hi>Light:</hi> Then, after this, there did a <hi>pure Fire</hi> appear in me: Then I ſaw, how he ſate as a <hi>Refiner's Fire,</hi> and as the <hi>Fuller's Sope.</hi> And then the <hi>Spiritual Diſcerning</hi> came into me, by which I did diſcern my own <hi>Thoughts, Groans</hi> and <hi>Sighs;</hi> and what it was, that did <hi>vail</hi> me, and what it was, that did <hi>open</hi> me. And that which could not abide in the <hi>Patience,</hi> nor endure the <hi>Fire,</hi> in the <hi>Light</hi> I found to be the <hi>Groans</hi> of the <hi>Fleſh</hi> (that could not give up to the <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>God</hi>) which had <hi>vailed</hi> me; and that could not be patient in all <hi>Trials, Troubles,</hi> and <hi>Anguiſhes</hi> and <hi>Perplexities,</hi> and could not give up <hi>Self</hi> to die by the <hi>Croſs,</hi> the Power of God, that the Living and Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned might follow him, and that that, which would cloud and vail from the Preſence of Chriſt, that which the <hi>Sword</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> cuts down, and which muſt die, might not be kept alive. And I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd the <hi>Groans</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which did <hi>open</hi> me, and made Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to God: In which <hi>Spirit</hi> is the true <hi>Waiting</hi> upon God, for the Redemption of the Body, and of the whole Creation. And by this true <hi>Spirit,</hi> in which the true Sighing is, I ſaw over the falſe Sighings and Groanings. And by this Inviſible <hi>Spirit</hi> I diſcerned all the <hi>falſe Hearing,</hi> and the <hi>falſe Seeing,</hi> and the <hi>falſe Smelling,</hi> which was a top, above the <hi>Spirit,</hi> quenching and grieving it; and that all they, that were there, were in <hi>Confuſion</hi> and <hi>Deceit,</hi> where the falſe Asking and Praying is, in <hi>Deceit</hi> and a top, in that Nature and Tongue, that takes Gods holy Name in vain, and wallows in the <hi>Egyptian Sea,</hi> and asketh, but hath not; for they hate his <hi>Light,</hi> and reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt, and turn the <hi>Grace</hi> into Wantonneſs, and rebel againſt the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and are erred from the <hi>Faith</hi> they ſhould ask in, and from the <hi>Spirit</hi> they ſhould pray by: He that knoweth theſe things in the true Spirit, can witneſs them. The divine <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> manifeſteth all things, and the ſpiritual <hi>Fire</hi> tryeth all things, and ſevereth all things. Several things did I then ſee, as the Lord opened them to me: For he ſhewed me that, which can live in his holy <hi>Refining Fire,</hi> and that can live to God under his <hi>Law.</hi> And he made me ſenſible, how the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi> were until <hi>John;</hi> and how the leaſt in the Everlaſting <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> is greater than
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51448:40"/> 
               <hi>John.</hi> The pure and perfect <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is over the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> to keep it, and its <hi>Works,</hi> which are not perfect, under, by the perfect <hi>Law:</hi> And the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> that is <hi>perfect,</hi> anſwers the perfect Principle of God in every one: And this <hi>Law</hi> the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> were to perform and do. None knows the <hi>Giver</hi> of this <hi>Law,</hi> but by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> neither can any truly read it, or hear its Voice, but by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God:</hi> He that can receive it, let him. <hi>John,</hi> who was the greateſt Prophet, that was born of a Woman, did bear Witneſs to the <hi>Light,</hi> which Chriſt, the Great heavenly Prophet, hath <hi>Enlightned every Man, that cometh into the World,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, that they might believe in it, and become the Children of <hi>Light,</hi> and ſo have the Light of Life; and not come into Condemnation. For the true <hi>Belief</hi> ſtands in the <hi>Light,</hi> that condemns all Evil, and the <hi>Devil,</hi> who is the Prince of Darkneſs, who would draw out of the <hi>Light</hi> into Condemnation. And they that walk in this <hi>Light,</hi> come to the <hi>Mountain</hi> of the Houſe of God, eſtabliſhed above all Mountains, and to <hi>God's Teaching,</hi> who will teach them his ways. Theſe things were opened to me in the <hi>Light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I ſaw the <hi>Mountains</hi> burning up, and the <hi>Rubbiſh;</hi> and the rough and crooked Ways and Places made ſmooth and plain, that the <hi>Lord</hi> might come into his <hi>Tabernacle.</hi> Theſe things are to be found in Man's Heart: But to ſpeak of theſe things being <hi>within,</hi> ſeemed ſtrange to the rough and crooked, and mountainous Ones. Yet the Lord ſaith, <hi>O Earth, hear the Word of the Lord!</hi> The <hi>Law</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> croſſeth the fleſhly Mind, Spirit and Will, which lives in Diſobedience, and doth not keep within the <hi>Law</hi> of the <hi>Spirit.</hi> And I ſaw, this <hi>Law</hi> was the pure <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which was upon me, and which I muſt go through; though I was troubled, while I was under it: For I could not be <hi>dead</hi> to the <hi>Law,</hi> but through the <hi>Law,</hi> which did judge and condemn that, which is to be condemned. I ſaw, many talked of the <hi>Law,</hi> who had never known the <hi>Law</hi> to be their <hi>School-maſter:</hi> And many talked of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> who had never known <hi>Life</hi> and Immortality brought to Light in them by it. You that have been under that <hi>School-maſter,</hi> and the Condemnation of it, know theſe things (for tho' the <hi>Lord</hi> in that day opened theſe things unto me in ſecret, they have ſince been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, by his Eternal <hi>Spirit,</hi> as on the Houſe top.) And as you are brought into the <hi>Law,</hi> and through the <hi>Law</hi> to be dead to it, and witneſs the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> fulfilled in you; ye will after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards come to know, what it is, to be brought into the <hi>Faith,</hi> and through <hi>Faith</hi> from under the <hi>Law.</hi> And abiding in the <hi>Faith,</hi> which Chriſt is the Author of, ye will have Peace and Acceſs to God. But if ye look out from the <hi>Faith,</hi> and from that which would keep you in the <hi>Victory,</hi> and look after fleſhly Things or Words, ye will be brought into Bondage to the Fleſh again; and to the <hi>Law,</hi> which takes hold upon the Fleſh and Sin, and worketh Wrath, and the Works of the Fleſh will appear again. The <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God</hi> takes hold upon the Law of Sin and Death: But the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> or the Law of the Spirit of Life, which is the Love of God, and which comes by Jeſus (who is the end of the <hi>Law</hi> for Righteouſneſs-ſake) this makes free from the <hi>Law</hi> of Sin and Death. This <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> fleſhly-minded
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51448:41"/> Men do not know; yet they will tempt you, to draw you from the <hi>Spirit</hi> into the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and ſo into Bondage. Therefore ye, who know the Love of God, and the <hi>Law</hi> of his <hi>Spirit,</hi> and the freedom that is in Jeſus Chriſt, ſtand faſt in him, in that divine <hi>Faith,</hi> which he is the Author of in you; and be not entangled with the Yoke of Bondage. For the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and his Teaching, bringeth into Liberty and Freedom: But the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> that is of <hi>Man,</hi> and by Man, and which ſtands in the Will of Man, bringeth into Bondage, and under the ſhadow of Death and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And therefore none can be a <hi>Miniſter</hi> of Chriſt Jeſus, but in the Eternal <hi>Spirit,</hi> which was before the <hi>Scriptures</hi> were given forth: For if they have not his <hi>Spirit,</hi> they are none of his. Though they may have his <hi>Light</hi> to condemn them, that hate it; yet they can never bring any into Unity and Fellowſhip in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> except they be in it. For the <hi>Seed</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is a burdenſome Stone to the ſelfiſh, fleſhly, earthly Will, which reigns in its own Knowledge and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, that muſt periſh, and in its <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> that is <hi>Deviliſh.</hi> And the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is grieved, and vexed, and quenched with that which brings into the fleſhly Bondage; and that which wars againſt the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> muſt be mortified by it: For the <hi>Fleſh</hi> luſteth againſt the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi> againſt the <hi>Fleſh;</hi> and theſe are contrary the one to the other. The <hi>Fleſh</hi> would have its Liberty; and the <hi>Spirit</hi> would have its Liberty: But the <hi>Spirit</hi> is to have its Liberry; and not the <hi>Fleſh.</hi> If therefore ye quench the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and join to the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and be Servants of it, then ye are judged and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by the <hi>Spirit:</hi> But if ye join to the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and ſerve God in it, ye have Liberty, and Victory over the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and its Works. Therefore keep in the daily <hi>Croſs,</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> by which ye may witneſs all that to be Crucified, which is contrary to the <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and which ſhall not come into his Kingdom. Theſe things are here mentioned and opened for Information, Exhortation and Comfort to others, as the Lord Opened them unto me in that day. And in that day I wondred, that the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur for <hi>Water</hi> and <hi>Victuals;</hi> for I could have faſted long without murmuring, or minding <hi>Victuals.</hi> But I was judged ſometimes, that I was not contented to be ſometimes without the <hi>Water</hi> and <hi>Bread</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> that I might learn to know, how to <hi>Want,</hi> and how to <hi>Abound.</hi>

            <p>About this time there was a great <hi>Meeting</hi> of the <hi>Baptiſts,</hi>

               </note> at <hi>Broughton</hi> in <hi>Leiceſter-ſhire,</hi> with ſome that had ſeparated from them; and People of other <hi>Notions</hi> went thither: And I went thither alſo. Not many of the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> came; but abundance of other People were there. And the <hi>Lord</hi> opened my Mouth, and his Everlaſting <hi>Truth</hi> was declared amongſt them; and the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> was over them all. For in that day the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> began to ſpring, and I had great <hi>Openings</hi> in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and ſeveral were <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced</hi> in thoſe Parts, and were turned from <hi>Darkneſs</hi> to <hi>Light,</hi> and from the Power of <hi>Satan</hi> unto <hi>God;</hi> and his <hi>Power</hi> they did receive, and by it many were raiſed up to praiſe God. And when I reaſoned with <hi>Profeſſors</hi> and other People, ſome were <hi>Convinced,</hi> and did ſtand. Yet I was under great <hi>Temptations</hi> ſometimes, and my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Sufferings were heavy; but I could find none to open my <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> to, but the <hi>Lord</hi> alone, unto whom I cryed Night and Day. And I went back into <hi>Nottingham-ſhire,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham-ſhire.</note> and there the Lord ſhewed me, that the <hi>Natures</hi> of thoſe things, which were <hi>hurtful without,</hi> were <hi>within</hi> in the Hearts and Minds of Wicked Men. The Natures of <hi>Dogs, Swine, Vipers,</hi> of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Egypt, Pharaoh, Cain, Iſhmael, Eſau,</hi> &amp;c. the <hi>Natures</hi> of theſe I ſaw <hi>within,</hi> though People had been looking <hi>without.</hi> And I cryed to the Lord, ſaying, <hi>Why ſhould I be thus, ſeeing I was never addicted to commit thoſe Evils?</hi> And the Lord anſwered, <hi>That it was needful, I ſhould have a ſenſe of all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; how elſe ſhould I ſpeak to all Conditions?</hi> And in this I ſaw the Infinite <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> I ſaw alſo, that there was an <hi>Ocean</hi> of <hi>Darkneſs</hi> and <hi>Death;</hi> but an infinite <hi>Ocean</hi> of <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> which flowed over the <hi>Ocean</hi> of <hi>Darkneſs:</hi> And in that alſo I ſaw the Infinite <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> and I had great Openings.

               <note place="margin">Mansfield.</note> the Lord ſaid unto me, <hi>That which People do trample upon, muſt be thy Food.</hi> And as the Lord ſpake, he opened it to me, how that <hi>People</hi> and <hi>Profeſſors</hi> did trample upon the <hi>Life,</hi> even the <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was tram<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>led upon; and they fed upon <hi>Words,</hi> and fed one another with <hi>Words;</hi> but trampled upon the <hi>Life:</hi> And trampled under Foot the <hi>Blood</hi> of the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God</hi> (which <hi>Blood</hi> was my <hi>Life;</hi>) and they lived in their airy Notions, talking of him. It ſeemed ſtrange to me at the firſt, that I ſhould feed on that, which the high <hi>Profeſſors</hi> trampled upon; but the <hi>Lord</hi> opened it clearly to me by his Eternal Spirit and Power.</p>
            <p>Then came People from far and near to ſee me: And I was fearful of being drawn out by them; yet I was made to ſpeak, and open things to them. <q>There was one <hi>Brown,</hi> who had great <hi>Prophecies</hi> and <hi>Sights</hi> upon his Death-bed of me. And he ſpake openly, of what I ſhould be made Inſtrumental by the Lord to bring forth. And of others he ſpake, that they ſhould come to nothing: Which was fulfilled on ſome, that then were ſomething in ſhew.</q> And when this Man was buried, a great <hi>Work</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> fell upon me, to the admiration of many, who thought I had been <hi>Dead:</hi> And many came to ſee me for about <hi>fourteen Days</hi> time; for I was very much altered in Countenance and Perſon, as if my Body had been New-moulded or changed. And while I was in that <hi>Condition,</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:51448:42"/> I had a ſenſe and diſcerning given me by the Lord,<note place="margin">1647.

Yet the <hi>Work</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> went on in ſome, and my Sorrows and Troubles began to wear off, and <hi>Tears</hi> of <hi>Joy</hi> dropped from me, ſo that I could have wept Night and Day with <hi>Tears</hi> of <hi>Joy</hi> to the Lord, in Humility and Brokenneſs of Heart. And I ſaw into that, which was without End, and things which cannot be uttered, and of the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Infinitneſs of the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which cannot be expreſt by Words. For I had been brought through the very <hi>Ocean</hi> of <hi>Darkneſs</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> and through the <hi>Power,</hi> and over the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Satan,</hi> by the Eternal, Glorious <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> even through that <hi>Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> was I brought, which covered-over all the Word, and which chained down all, and ſhut up all in the <hi>Death.</hi> And the ſame Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which brought me through theſe Things, was that, which afterwards ſhook the <hi>Nations, Prieſts, Profeſſors</hi> and <hi>People.</hi> Then could I ſay, I had been in Spiritual <hi>Babylon, Sodom, Egypt</hi> and the <hi>Grave;</hi> but by the Eternal <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God</hi> I was come out of it, and was brought over it, and the Power of it, into the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And I ſaw the <hi>Harveſt WHITE,</hi> and the <hi>Seed</hi> of <hi>God</hi> lying thick in the Ground, as ever did <hi>Wheat,</hi> that was ſown out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly; and none to gather it: And for this I mourned with Tears. And a Report went abroad of me, That I was a <hi>Young Man, that had a diſcerning Spirit:</hi> Whereupon many came to me, from far and near, <hi>Profeſſors, Prieſts</hi> and <hi>People;</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> brake forth: And I had great <hi>Openings</hi> and <hi>Prophecies;</hi> and ſpake unto them of the <hi>Things</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and they heard with Attention and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; and went away, and ſpread the Fame thereof. Then came the <hi>Tempter,</hi> and ſet upon me again, charging me; That I had <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> But I could not tell in what. And then <hi>Paul's Condition</hi> came before me, how, after he had been taken up into the <hi>Third Heavens,</hi> and ſeen things not lawful to be uttered, a <hi>Meſſenger</hi> of <hi>Satan</hi> was ſent to buffet him again. Thus by the <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> I got over that <hi>Temptation</hi> alſo.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1648"/> In the Year 1648, as I was ſitting in a <hi>Friend</hi>'s Houſe in <hi>Nottin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghamſhire</hi> (for by this time the Power of God had opened the Hearts of ſome to receive the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Reconciliation</hi>) I ſaw, there was a great <hi>Crack</hi> to go throughout the <hi>Earth,</hi> and a great <hi>Smoke</hi> to go, as the <hi>Crack</hi> went; and that after the <hi>Crack</hi> there ſhould be a great <hi>Shaking:</hi> This was the <hi>Earth</hi> in People's <hi>Hearts,</hi> which was to be ſhaken, before the <hi>Seed</hi> of <hi>God</hi> was raiſed out of the <hi>Earth.</hi> And it was ſo; for the Lord's Power began to <hi>ſhake</hi> them, and great <hi>Meetings</hi> we began to have, and a mighty <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Work</hi> of <hi>God</hi> there was amongſt People, to the Aſtoniſhment of both <hi>People</hi> and <hi>Prieſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And there was a <hi>Meeting</hi> of <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Profeſſors</hi> at a <hi>Juſtice</hi>'s Houſe, and I went among them. And there they diſcourſed, how <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>He had not known Sin, but by the Law, which ſaid, Thou ſhalt not luſt:</hi> And they held that to be ſpoken of the <hi>outward Law.</hi> But I told them, <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake that, after he was <hi>Convinced:</hi> For he had the <hi>outward Law</hi> before, and was bred up in it, when he was in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51448:42"/> the <hi>Lust</hi> of <hi>Perſecution;</hi> but this was the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in his Mind, which he ſerved, and which the <hi>Law</hi> in his <hi>Members</hi> warred againſt: For that which he thought had been <hi>Life</hi> to him, proved <hi>Death.</hi> So the more ſober of the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Profeſſors</hi> yielded, and conſented, that it was not the <hi>Outward Law,</hi> but the <hi>Inward,</hi> which ſhewed the <hi>Inward Luſt,</hi> which <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake of, after he was <hi>Convinced:</hi> For the <hi>outward Law</hi> took hold upon the <hi>outward Action;</hi> but the <hi>Inward Law</hi> upon the <hi>Inward Luſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this I went again to <hi>Mansfield,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mansfield.</note> where was a great <hi>Meeting</hi> of <hi>Profeſſors</hi> and <hi>People:</hi> And I was moved to <hi>Pray.</hi> And the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> was ſo great, that the <hi>Houſe</hi> ſeemed to be <hi>ſhaken.</hi> And when I had done, ſome of the <hi>Profeſſors</hi> ſaid, <hi>It was now, as in the Days of the</hi> Apoſtles, <hi>when the Houſe was ſhaken, where they were:</hi> After I had <hi>prayed,</hi> one of the <hi>Profeſſors</hi> would <hi>pray;</hi> which brought Deadneſs and a Vail over them: And others of the <hi>Profeſſors</hi> were grieved at him, and told him, <hi>It was a Temptation upon him.</hi> Then he came to me, and deſired, that I would <hi>pray</hi> again: But I could not <hi>pray</hi> in Man's Will.</p>
            <p>Soon after there was another great <hi>Meeting</hi> of <hi>Profeſſors,</hi> and a <hi>Captain</hi> (whoſe Name was <hi>Amor Stoddard</hi>) came in: And they were diſcourſing of the <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And as they were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing of it, I ſaw, through the immediate Opening of the <hi>Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Spirit,</hi> the <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And I cryed out among them, and ſaid; <hi>Do ye not ſee the</hi> Blood <hi>of</hi> Chriſt? <hi>See it in your Hearts, to ſprinkle your Hearts and Conſciences from Dead Works, to ſerve the Living God:</hi> For I ſaw it, the <hi>Blood</hi> of the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> how it came into the <hi>Heart.</hi> This ſtartled the <hi>Profeſſors,</hi> who would have the <hi>Blood</hi> only <hi>without</hi> them, and not in them. But <hi>Captain Stoddard</hi> was reached, and ſaid; <hi>Let the Youth ſpeak; hear the Youth ſpeak;</hi> when he ſaw, they endeavoured to bear me down with many Words.</p>
            <p>There were alſo a Company of <hi>Prieſts</hi> that were looked upon to be tender (one of their Names was <hi>Kellet</hi>) and ſeveral People, that were tender, went to hear them. And I was moved to go after them, and bid them, <hi>Mind the Lord's Teaching in their inward Parts.</hi> That <hi>Prieſt Kellet</hi> was againſt <hi>Parſonages</hi> then; but afterwards he got a great <hi>One,</hi> and turned a <hi>Perſecutor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, after I had had ſome Service in theſe Parts,<note place="margin">Derbyſhire, Leiceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</note> I went through <hi>Derbyſhire</hi> into my own Country <hi>Leiceſterſhire</hi> again, and ſeveral tender People were <hi>Convinced.</hi> And paſſing thence, I met with a great Company of <hi>Profeſſors</hi> in <hi>Warwickſhire,</hi> who were Praying,<note place="margin">Warwick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</note> and Expounding the <hi>Scriptures</hi> in the Fields; and they gave the <hi>Bible</hi> to me, and I opened it on the <hi>Fifth</hi> of <hi>Matthew,</hi> where <hi>Chriſt</hi> expounded the <hi>Law:</hi> And I opened the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward State</hi> to them, and the <hi>Outward State;</hi> and they fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a feirce Contention, and ſo parted: But the Lord's Power got Ground.</p>
            <p>Then I heard of a great <hi>Meeting</hi> to be at <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> for a <hi>Diſpute,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Leiceſter.</note> wherein both <hi>Presbyterians, Independents, Baptiſts</hi> and <hi>Common-Prayer-Men</hi> were ſaid to be all concerned. The <hi>Meeting</hi> was in a <hi>Steeple-houſe;</hi> and thither I was moved by the <hi>Lord God</hi> to go, and

               </note> And I heard their Diſcourſe and Reaſonings, ſome being in <hi>Pews,</hi> and the <hi>Prieſt</hi> in the <hi>Pulpit;</hi> abundance of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple being gathered together. At laſt one <hi>Woman</hi> asked a Queſtion out of <hi>Peter, What that Birth was,</hi> viz. <hi>A being born again of Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible Seed, by the Word of God, that liveth and abideth for ever?</hi> And the <hi>Priest</hi> ſaid to her, <hi>I permit not a Woman to ſpeak in the Church;</hi> though he had before given liberty for any to ſpeak. Whereupon I was wrapt up, as in a <hi>Rapture,</hi> in the <hi>Lord's Power;</hi> and I ſtepped up in a Place, and asked the <hi>Priest; Doſt thou call this Place (the</hi> Steeple-houſe) <hi>a Church? Or doſt thou call this mixt Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude a Church?</hi> For the <hi>Woman</hi> asking a Queſtion, he ought to have anſwered it, having given <hi>liberty</hi> for any to ſpeak. But he did not anſwer me neither; but asked me, <hi>What a Church was?</hi> I told him, <hi>The</hi> Church <hi>was the</hi> Pillar <hi>and</hi> Ground <hi>of</hi> Truth, <hi>made up of living Stones, living Members, a ſpiritual Houſhold, which Chriſt was the Head of: But he was not the Head of a mixt Multitude, or of an old Houſe made up of</hi> Lime, Stones <hi>and</hi> Wood: This ſet them all on Fire. The <hi>Prieſt</hi> came down out of his <hi>Pulpit,</hi> and others out of their <hi>Pews,</hi> and the <hi>Diſpute</hi> there was marr'd. But I went to a great <hi>Inn,</hi> and there diſputed the thing with the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Profeſſors</hi> of all ſorts; and they were all on a Fire. But I maintained the true <hi>Church,</hi> and the true <hi>Head</hi> thereof, over the Heads of them all, till they all gave out, and fled away. And there was one Man, that ſeemed <hi>loving,</hi> and appeared for a while to join with me; but he ſoon turned againſt me, and joined with a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> in pleading for <hi>Infant's Baptiſm;</hi> tho' he himſelf had been a <hi>Baptiſt</hi> before: And ſo left me alone. Howbeit there were ſeveral <hi>Convinced</hi> that day: and the <hi>Woman,</hi> that asked the Queſtion aforeſaid, was <hi>Convinced,</hi> and her Family: And the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> ſhined over all.</p>

               </note>After this I returned into <hi>Nottingham-ſhire</hi> again, and went into the <hi>Vale</hi> of <hi>Beavor.</hi> And as I went, I preached <hi>Repentance</hi> to the People:<note place="margin">Vale of Beavor.</note> And there were many <hi>Convinced</hi> in the <hi>Vale</hi> of <hi>Beavor,</hi> in many Towns; for I ſtayed ſome Weeks amongſt them.

And it was ſaid; <hi>All things come by Nature;</hi> And the <hi>Elements</hi> and <hi>Stars</hi> came over me; ſo that I was in a manner quite <hi>clouded</hi> with it: But inaſmuch as I ſate ſtill, and ſaid nothing, the People of the Houſe perceived no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.

Then afterwards I went to <hi>Mansfield</hi> and there-a-way; where the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> was wonderfully manifeſted both at <hi>Mansfield,</hi> and other Towns there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts. And in <hi>Darby-ſhire</hi> the mighty Power of God wrought in a wonderful manner. At <hi>Eton,</hi> a Town near <hi>Darby,</hi> there was a <hi>Meeting</hi> of <hi>Friends,</hi> where there was ſuch a mighty <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> that they were <hi>greatly Shaken,</hi> and many Mouths were opened in the Power of the Lord God. And many were moved by the Lord to go to <hi>Steeple-houſes,</hi> to the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and to the <hi>People,</hi> to declare the Everlaſting Truth unto them.</p>
            <p>And at a certain time, when I was at <hi>Mansfield,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mansfield.</note> there was a <hi>Sitting</hi> of the <hi>Juſtices,</hi> about hiring of <hi>Servants;</hi> and it was upon me from the Lord, to go and ſpeak to the <hi>Juſtices, That they ſhould not oppreſs the Servants in their Wages.</hi> So I walked towards the <hi>Inn,</hi> where they ſate; but finding a Company of <hi>Fidlers</hi> there, I did not go in, but thought to come in the Morning, when I might have a more ſerious Opportunity to diſcourſe them; not thinking that a ſeaſonable time. But when I came again in the Morning, they were gone, and I was <hi>ſtruck</hi> even <hi>blind,</hi> that I could not ſee. And I inquired of the <hi>Inn-keeper,</hi> where the <hi>Juſtices</hi> were to ſit that day? And he told me, <hi>At a Town eight Miles off.</hi> And my <hi>Sight</hi> began to come to me again; and I went, and Ran thitherward, as faſt as I could. And when I was come to the Houſe, where they were, and many <hi>Servants</hi> with them, I exhorted the <hi>Justices, Not to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the Servants in their Wages; but to do that which was Right and Just to them:</hi> And I exhorted the <hi>Servants, To do their Duties, and ſerve honeſtly,</hi> &amp;c. And they all received my Exhortation kindly; for I was moved of the Lord therein.</p>
            <p>Moreover I was moved to go to ſeveral <hi>Courts,</hi> and <hi>Steeple-houſes</hi> at <hi>Mansfield,</hi> and other Places, to warn them to leave off <hi>Oppreſſion</hi> and <hi>Oaths,</hi> and to turn from <hi>Deceit,</hi> and to turn to the <hi>Lord,</hi> and do juſtly. Particularly at <hi>Mansfield,</hi> after I had been at a <hi>Court</hi> there, I was moved to go, and ſpeak to one of the <hi>Wicked'ſt Men</hi> in the <hi>Country,</hi> one who was a <hi>Common Drunkard,</hi> a noted <hi>Whore-maſter,</hi> and a <hi>Rime-maker:</hi> And I reproved him, in the dread of the Mighty God, for his evil Courſes. And when I had done Speaking, and left him, he came after me, and told me; <hi>That he was ſo ſmitten, when I ſpake to him, that he had ſcarce any Strength left in him.</hi> So this Man was Convinced, and turned from his Wickedneſs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained an honeſt, ſober Man, to the Aſtoniſhment of the People, who had known him before. Thus the Work of the Lord went forward, and many were turned from the <hi>Darkneſs</hi> to the <hi>Light,</hi> within the compaſs of theſe three Years, 1646, 1647, and 1648. And divers <hi>Meetings</hi> of <hi>Friends,</hi> in ſeveral Places, were then ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered to Gods Teaching, by his Light, Spirit and Power: For the Lord's Power brake forth daily more and more, wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullly.</p>

And the Lord ſhewed me, that ſuch as were faithful to him in the Power and Light of Chriſt, ſhould come up into that <hi>State,</hi> in which <hi>Adam</hi> was before he fell: In which the admirable <hi>Works</hi> of the <hi>Creation,</hi> and the <hi>Vertues</hi> thereof may be known, through the Openings of that divine <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> by which they were made.

            </p>
            <p>Thus traveled I on in the <hi>Lord's Service,</hi> as the Lord led me. And when I came to <hi>Nottingham,</hi>

While I was there, the Lord opened to me <hi>Three Things,</hi> relating to thoſe <hi>Three great Profeſſions</hi> in the World, <hi>Phyſick, Divinity</hi> (ſo called) and <hi>Law.</hi> And he ſhewed me, that the <hi>Phyſicians</hi> and <hi>Doctors</hi> of <hi>Phyſick</hi> were out of the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> by which the Creatures were made; and ſo knew not the <hi>Vertues</hi> of the <hi>Creatures,</hi> becauſe they were out of the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> by which they were made. And he ſhewed me, that the <hi>Prieſts</hi> were out of the true <hi>Faith,</hi> which Chriſt is the Author of; the <hi>Faith</hi> which purifies and gives Victory, and brings People to have Acceſs to God, by which they pleaſe God: Which <hi>Myſtery</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> is held in a pure Conſcience. He ſhewed me alſo, that the <hi>Lawyers</hi> were out of the <hi>Equity,</hi> and out of the true <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and out of the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which went over the firſt Tranſgreſſion, and over all <hi>Sin,</hi> and anſwered the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> that was grieved, and tranſgreſſed in Man. And that theſe three, the <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and the <hi>Lawyers,</hi> ruled the World out of the <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> out of the <hi>Faith,</hi> and out of the <hi>Equity</hi> and <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> the one pretending the Cure of the <hi>Body,</hi> the other the Cure of the <hi>Soul,</hi> and the third the <hi>Property</hi> of the People. But I ſaw, they were all out, out of the <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> out of the <hi>Faith,</hi> out of the <hi>Equity</hi> and perfect <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> And as the Lord opened theſe things unto me, I felt his Power went forth over all, by which all might be <hi>Reformed,</hi> if they would receive and bow unto it. The <hi>Prieſts</hi> might be Reformed, and brought into the true <hi>Faith,</hi> which was the <hi>Gift</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> The <hi>Lawyers</hi> might be Reformed, and

               <note place="margin">1648.

Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance was opened concerning theſe things; how all lay out of the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and out of the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Holineſs,</hi> that Man at the firſt was made in: But as all believe in the <hi>Light,</hi> and walk in the <hi>Light,</hi> which <hi>Chriſt hath enlightned every Man, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into the World, withal,</hi> and ſo become Children of the <hi>Light,</hi> and of the <hi>Day</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in his Day all things are ſeen, <hi>Viſible</hi> and <hi>Inviſible,</hi> by the Divine <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Spiritual, Heavenly Man, by whom all things were made and Created.</p>
            <p>Then I ſaw concerning the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> that although they ſtood in the <hi>Deceit,</hi> and acted by the <hi>dark Power,</hi> which both <hi>they</hi> and their <hi>People</hi> were kept under; yet they were not the <hi>greateſt Deceivers</hi> ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in the <hi>Scriptures:</hi> For theſe were not come ſo far, as many of them had come. But the Lord opened to me, who the <hi>greateſt Deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> were, and how far they might come; even ſuch as came as far as <hi>Cain,</hi> to hear the <hi>Voice</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> and ſuch as came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and through the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> and to praiſe God on the <hi>Banks</hi> of the <hi>Sea-ſhore;</hi> ſuch as could ſpeak by Experience of God's <hi>Miracles</hi> and <hi>Wonders;</hi> ſuch as were come as far as <hi>Corah</hi> and <hi>Dathan,</hi> and their <hi>Company;</hi> ſuch as came as far as <hi>Balaam,</hi> who could ſpeak the <hi>Word</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> who heard his <hi>Voice</hi> and knew it, and knew his <hi>Spirit;</hi> and could ſee the <hi>Star</hi> of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and the goodlineſs of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s Tent; the <hi>Second Birth,</hi> which no <hi>Enchantment</hi> could prevail againſt: Theſe that could ſpeak ſo much of their <hi>Experiences</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and yet turned from the <hi>Spirit</hi> and the <hi>Word,</hi> and went into the <hi>Gainſaying; Theſe</hi> were, and would be the <hi>great Deceivers,</hi> far beyond the <hi>Prieſts.</hi> Likewiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> ſuch as ſhould preach in Chriſt's Name, and ſhould work <hi>Miracles,</hi> caſt out <hi>Devils,</hi> and go as far as a <hi>Cain,</hi> a <hi>Core</hi> and a <hi>Balaam</hi> in the Goſpel-times, <hi>Theſe</hi> were and would be the <hi>great Deceivers;</hi> they that could ſpeak ſome <hi>Experiences</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>God,</hi> but lived not in the <hi>Life.</hi> Theſe were they, that led the World after them, who got the <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> but denyed the <hi>Power;</hi> who inwardly ravened from the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and brought People into the <hi>Form;</hi> but perſecuted them, that were in the <hi>Power</hi> (as <hi>Cain</hi> did) and ran greedily after the <hi>Error</hi> of <hi>Balaam,</hi> through Covetouſneſs, loving the Wages of Unrighteouſneſs, as <hi>Balaam</hi> did. Theſe Followers of <hi>Cain, Core</hi> and <hi>Balaam</hi> have brought the World ſince the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Days to be like a <hi>Sea.</hi> And ſuch as theſe, I ſaw, might <hi>deceive</hi> now, as they had in former Ages: But it is impoſſible for them to <hi>deceive</hi> the <hi>Elect,</hi> who were choſen in Chriſt, who was, before the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, and before <hi>Deceiver</hi> was: Though others may be deceived in their <hi>Openings</hi> and <hi>Prophecies,</hi> not keeping their Minds to the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who doth Open and Reveal to his.</p>
            <pb n="20" facs="tcp:51448:45"/>
            <p>And I ſaw the <hi>State</hi> of thoſe both <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> who in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Scriptures</hi> cry out much againſt <hi>Cain, Eſau,</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> and other wicked Men of former Times, mentioned in the <hi>Holy Scriptures;</hi> but do not ſee the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Cain,</hi> of <hi>Eſau,</hi> of <hi>Judas,</hi> and thoſe Others in <hi>themſelves.</hi> And theſe ſaid, <hi>It was</hi> They, They, They, <hi>that were the bad People;</hi> putting it off from themſelves: But when ſome of theſe came with the <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> to ſee into themſelves, then they came to ſay, <hi>I, I, I,</hi> it is <hi>I my ſelf, that have been the</hi> Iſhmael, <hi>and the</hi> Eſau, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For then they came to ſee the Nature of wild <hi>Iſhmael</hi> in themſelves; the Nature of <hi>Cain,</hi> of <hi>Eſau,</hi> of <hi>Corah,</hi> of <hi>Balaam,</hi> and of the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Perdition</hi> in themſelves, ſitting above all that is called <hi>God</hi> in them. So I ſaw, it was the <hi>fallen Man,</hi> that was got up into the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and was finding Fault with thoſe before-mentioned; and with the back-ſliding <hi>Jews,</hi> calling them the <hi>ſturdy Oaks,</hi> and <hi>tall Cedars,</hi> and <hi>fat Bulls</hi> of <hi>Baſhan, wild Heifers, Vipers, Serpents,</hi> &amp;c. And charging them, that it was <hi>They,</hi> that cloſed their Eyes, and ſtopped their Ears, and hardned their Hearts, and were dull of Hearing: And that it was <hi>They,</hi> that hated the <hi>Light,</hi> and rebelled againſt it, and that quenched the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and grieved it, and walked deſpightfully againſt the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> and turned the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>God</hi> into Wantonneſs: And that it was <hi>They,</hi> that reſiſted the Holy Ghoſt; and <hi>They,</hi> that got the Form of Godlineſs, and turned againſt the Power: And that <hi>They</hi> were the inwardly <hi>Ravening Wolves,</hi> that had got the <hi>Sheep's Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> And that <hi>They</hi> were the <hi>Wells</hi> without <hi>Water,</hi> and <hi>Clouds</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Rain,</hi> and <hi>Trees</hi> without <hi>Fruit,</hi> &amp;c. But when theſe (who were ſo much taken up with finding <hi>Fault</hi> with others, and thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves clear from theſe Things) came to look into themſelves, and with the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> throughly to ſearch themſelves, they might ſee enough of this in themſelves: and then the <hi>Cry</hi> could not be, <hi>It is He,</hi> or <hi>They,</hi> as before; but <hi>I,</hi> and <hi>We</hi> are found in theſe Conditions.</p>
            <p>I ſaw alſo, how People <hi>Read the</hi> Scriptures <hi>without a right Senſe of them,</hi> and without duly applying them to their own <hi>States.</hi> For when they read, that <hi>Death reigned from</hi> Adam <hi>to</hi> Moſes; and that the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi> were until <hi>John;</hi> and that the leaſt in the Kingdom is greater than <hi>John;</hi> they read theſe things <hi>without</hi> them, and applyed them to <hi>others</hi> without them (and the Things were true of <hi>others</hi> without them:) but they did not turn in to find the <hi>Truth</hi> of theſe things in themſelves. But as theſe things came to be opened in me, I ſaw, <hi>Death</hi> reigned over them from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> from the Entrance into <hi>Trangreſſion,</hi> till they came to the Miniſtration of <hi>Condemnation,</hi> which reſtrains People from <hi>Sin,</hi> that brings <hi>Death.</hi> Then when the <hi>Miniſtration</hi> of <hi>Moſes</hi> is paſſed through, the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry</hi> of the <hi>Prophets</hi> comes to be read and underſtood, which reaches through the <hi>Figures, Types</hi> and <hi>Shadows</hi> unto <hi>John,</hi> the greateſt <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> born of a <hi>Woman;</hi> whoſe <hi>Miniſtration</hi> prepares the <hi>Way</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> by bringing down the exalted Mountains, and making ſtrait Paths. And as this <hi>Miniſtration</hi> is paſſed through, an Entrance comes to be known into the Everlaſting Kingdom. So I ſaw plainly, that none could read <hi>Moſes</hi> aright, without <hi>Moſes</hi>'s <hi>Spirit,</hi> by which
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51448:45"/> 
               <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaw, how <hi>Man</hi> was in the <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Paradice,</hi> and how he fell, and how <hi>Death</hi> came over him, and how all Men have been under this <hi>Death.</hi> And I ſaw, how <hi>Moſes</hi> received the pure <hi>Law,</hi> that went over all Tranſgreſſors; and how the <hi>clean Beaſts,</hi> which were <hi>Figures</hi> and <hi>Types,</hi> were offered up, when the People were come into the righteous <hi>Law,</hi> that went over the firſt Tranſgreſſion. And both <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi> ſaw through the <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Figures,</hi> and beyond them, and ſaw <hi>Chriſt</hi> the great <hi>Prophet,</hi> that was to come to fulfil them. And I ſaw, that none could read <hi>John</hi>'s Words aright, and with a true Underſtanding of them, but in and with the ſame Divine <hi>Spirit,</hi> by which <hi>John</hi> ſpake them; and by his burning, ſhining <hi>Light,</hi> which is ſent from God. For by that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit their <hi>Crooked Natures</hi> might be made ſtrait, and their <hi>Rough Natures</hi> ſmooth, and the Exacter and violent Doer in them might be thrown out: And they that had been <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> might come to bring forth Fruits meet for Repentance, and their <hi>Mountain</hi> of <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs</hi> might be laid low in them, and their <hi>Valley</hi> exalted in them; that there might be a <hi>Way</hi> prepared for the <hi>Lord</hi> in them: And then the leaſt in the Kingdom is greater than <hi>John.</hi> But all muſt firſt know <hi>the Voice crying in their Wilderneſs,</hi> in their Hearts, which through Tranſgreſſion were become as a <hi>Wilderneſs.</hi> Thus I ſaw, it was an eaſie matter to ſay, <hi>Death reigned from</hi> Adam <hi>to</hi> Moſes; and, <hi>That the Law and the Prophets were until</hi> John; and, <hi>That the leaſt in the Kingdom is greater than</hi> John: But none could know, <hi>how</hi> Death reigned from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> &amp;c. but by the ſame Holy Spirit, which <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> were in. They could not know the Spiritual Meaning of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>John's</hi> Words, nor ſee their <hi>Path</hi> and <hi>Travels,</hi> much leſs ſee through them, and to the end of them into the Kingdom; unleſs they had the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Jeſus:</hi> Nor could they know the <hi>Words</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and of his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> without his <hi>Spirit.</hi> But as Man comes through, by the Spirit and Power of God, to Chriſt (who fulfills the <hi>Types, Figures, Shadows, Promiſes</hi> and <hi>Prophecies,</hi> that were of him) and is led by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> into the Truth and Subſtance of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> ſitting down in him, who is the <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>End</hi> of them; then are they read, and underſtood, with profit and great Delight.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the Lord God let me ſee (when I was brought up into his Image, in Righteouſneſs and Holineſs, and into the <hi>Paradiſe</hi> of <hi>God</hi>) the State, <hi>How</hi> Adam <hi>was made a Living Soul:</hi> And alſo the <hi>Stature</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Myſtery,</hi> that had been hid from Ages and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations: Which things are hard to be uttered; and cannot be born by many. For of all the <hi>Sects</hi> in <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> (ſo called) that I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſed withal, I found none, that could bear to be told, that any ſhould come to <hi>Adam</hi>'s <hi>Perfection,</hi> into that Image of God, and Righteouſneſs, and Holineſs, that <hi>Adam</hi> was in, before he <hi>fell;</hi> to be ſo clear and pure without <hi>Sin,</hi> as he was. Therefore, how ſhould they be able to bear, being told, that any ſhould grow up to the <hi>Meaſure of the Stature of the Fulneſs of Chriſt,</hi> when they cannot bear to hear, that any ſhall come, whilſt upon Earth, into the ſame <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> that the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were in? Though
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51448:46"/> it be a certain Truth, that none can underſtand their <hi>Writings</hi> aright, without the ſame <hi>Spirit,</hi> by which they were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
            <p>Now the Lord God hath opened to me by his inviſible Power, how that <hi>Every Man was enlightned by the Divine Light of Chriſt;</hi> and I ſaw it ſhine through all: And that they, that believed in it, came out of <hi>Condemnation,</hi> and came to the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> and became the Children of it: But they that hated it, and did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in it, were <hi>Condemned</hi> by it; though they made a <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of Chriſt. This I ſaw in the pure Openings of the <hi>Light,</hi> without the help of any Man; neither did I then know, where to find it in the <hi>Scriptures</hi> (though afterwards, ſearching the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> I found it.) For I ſaw in that <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> which was, before <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi> was given forth, and which led the Holy Men of God to give them forth, That all muſt come to that <hi>Spirit,</hi> if they would know <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or the <hi>Scriptures</hi> aright, which They that gave them forth, were led and taught by.</p>
            <p>But I obſerved a <hi>Dulneſs</hi> and <hi>Drowzy Heavineſs</hi> upon People, which I wondred at: For ſometimes, when I would ſet my ſelf to <hi>ſleep,</hi> my Mind went over all to the Beginning, in that which is from Everlaſting to Everlaſting. And I ſaw, <hi>Death</hi> was to paſs over this <hi>ſleepy, heavy State.</hi> And I told People, they muſt come to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>Death</hi> to that <hi>ſleepy, heavy Nature,</hi> and a <hi>Croſs</hi> to it in the Power of God, that their Minds and Hearts might be on things above.</p>
            <p>And on a certain Time, as I was walking in the <hi>Fields,</hi> the Lord ſaid unto me; <q>Thy Name is written in the <hi>Lamb</hi>'s <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> which was before the Foundation of the World.</q> And as the Lord ſpake it, I believed, and ſaw it in the <hi>New Birth.</hi> Then ſometime after the <hi>Lord</hi> commanded me to go abroad into the <hi>World,</hi> which was like a <hi>briary, thorny Wilderneſs.</hi> And when I came in the <hi>Lord</hi>'s mighty <hi>Power,</hi> with the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> into the <hi>World,</hi> the <hi>World</hi> ſwelled, and made a Noiſe, like the great raging <hi>Waves</hi> of the <hi>Sea. Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Profeſſors, Magiſtrates</hi> and <hi>People</hi> were all like a <hi>Sea,</hi> when I came to proclaim the <hi>Day</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> amongſt them, and to preach <hi>Repentance</hi> to them.</p>
            <p>Now I was ſent <hi>to turn People from Darkneſs to the Light,</hi> that they might receive Chriſt Jeſus: For to as many as ſhould receive him in his <hi>Light,</hi> I ſaw, that he would give Power to become the <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>God:</hi> Which I had obtained by receiving Chriſt. And I was to direct People to the <hi>Spirit,</hi> that gave forth the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> by which they might be led into all <hi>Truth,</hi> and ſo up to <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>God,</hi> as they had been, who gave them forth. And I was to turn them to the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and to the <hi>Truth</hi> in the Heart, which came by Jeſus; that by this <hi>Grace</hi> they might be taught, which would bring them <hi>Salvation,</hi> that their Hearts might be eſtabliſhed by it, and their Words might be ſeaſoned, and all might come to know their <hi>Salvation</hi> nigh. For I ſaw, that Chriſt had <hi>died for all Men, and was a Propitiation for all;</hi> and had enlightned all Men and Women with his divine and ſaving <hi>Light:</hi> And that none could be a true <hi>Believer,</hi> but who believed in it. I ſaw, that the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51448:46"/> 
               <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which brings Salvation, had appeared to <hi>all Men,</hi> and that the Manifeſtation of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> was given to every Man, to profit withal. Theſe Things I did not ſee by the help of <hi>Man,</hi> nor by the <hi>Letter</hi> (tho' they are written in the <hi>Letter;</hi>) but I ſaw them in the <hi>Light</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, and by his immediate <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> as did the Holy Men of God, by whom the Holy <hi>Scriptures</hi> were written. Yet I had no ſlight eſteem of the Holy <hi>Scriptures;</hi> but they were very precious to me: For I was in that <hi>Spirit,</hi> by which they were given forth; and what the Lord opened in me, I afterwards found was agreeable to them. I could ſpeak much of theſe things, and many <hi>Volumes</hi> might be written; but all would prove too ſhort to ſet forth the <hi>Infinite Love, Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> in prepairing, fitting and furniſhing me for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice he had appointed me to; letting me ſee the <hi>Depths</hi> of <hi>Satan</hi> on the one Hand, and opening to me, on the other Hand, the divine <hi>Myſteries</hi> of his own Everlaſting Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Now when the <hi>Lord God,</hi> and his Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> did ſend me forth into the World, to preach his Everlaſting <hi>Goſpel</hi> and <hi>Kingdom,</hi> I was glad, that I was Commanded To turn People to that Inward <hi>Light, Spirit</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> by which all might know their Salvation, and their Way to God; even that divine <hi>Spirit,</hi> which would lead them into all <hi>Truth,</hi> and which I infallibly knew, would never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any.</p>
            <p>But with and by this divine <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> I was to bring People off from all their own <hi>ways,</hi> to Chriſt the new and living <hi>Way;</hi> and from their <hi>Churches</hi> (which Men had made and gathered) to the <hi>Church</hi> in <hi>God,</hi> the general Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly written in Heaven, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the <hi>Head</hi> of; And off from the World's <hi>Teachers,</hi> made by Men, to learn of Chriſt, who is the Way, the Truth and the Life, of whom the Father ſaid, <hi>This is my beloved Son, hear ye him;</hi> and off from all the Worlds <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips,</hi> to know the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> in the inward Parts, and to be led <hi>thereby;</hi> that in it they might Worſhip the <hi>Father</hi> of <hi>Spirits,</hi> who ſeeks ſuch to Worſhip him: Which <hi>Spirit</hi> they that Worſhipped not in, knew not, what they Worſhipped. And I was to bring People off from all the World's <hi>Religions,</hi> which are vain; that they might know the pure <hi>Religion,</hi> and might viſit the <hi>Fatherleſs,</hi> the <hi>Widows</hi> and the <hi>Strangers,</hi> and keep themſelves from the Spots of the World: And then there would not be ſo many <hi>Beggars;</hi> the ſight of whom often grieved my Heart, to ſee ſo much Hard-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs amongſt them, that profeſſed the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And I was to bring them off from all the World's <hi>Fellowſhips,</hi> and <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> and <hi>Singings,</hi> which ſtood in <hi>Forms</hi> without <hi>Power;</hi> that their <hi>Fellowſhips</hi> might be in the Holy Ghoſt, and in the Eternal <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> that they might <hi>Pray</hi> in the Holy Ghoſt, and <hi>Sing</hi> in the Spirit, and with the <hi>Grace,</hi> that comes by Jeſus; making <hi>Melody</hi> in their Hearts to the Lord, who hath ſent his beloved Son to be their Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; and cauſed his heavenly <hi>Sun</hi> to ſhine upon all the World, and through them all, and his heavenly <hi>Rain</hi> to fall upon the Juſt and the Unjuſt (as his outward <hi>Rain</hi> doth fall, and his outward <hi>Sun</hi> doth ſhine on all) which is <hi>God's</hi> unſpeakable <hi>Love</hi> to the World.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51448:47"/> And I was to bring People off from <hi>Jewiſh Ceremonies,</hi> and from <hi>Heatheniſh Fables,</hi> and from Mens <hi>Inventions</hi> and windy <hi>Doctrines,</hi> by which they blowed the People about, this way and the other way, from <hi>Sect</hi> to <hi>Sect;</hi> and all their beggarly Rudiments, with their <hi>Schools</hi> and <hi>Colledges,</hi> for making <hi>Miniſters</hi> of Chriſt, who are indeed <hi>Miniſters</hi> of their own making, but not of Chriſt's. And all their <hi>Images</hi> and <hi>Croſſes,</hi> and <hi>Sprinkling of Infants,</hi> with all their <hi>Holy-days</hi> (ſo called) and all their vain <hi>Traditions,</hi> which they had gotten up ſince the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Days, which the Lord's Power was againſt: And in the Dread and Authority thereof was I moved to declare againſt them all; and againſt all that <hi>Preached,</hi> and not <hi>freely;</hi> as being ſuch, as had not <hi>Received freely</hi> from Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Moreover, when the Lord ſent me forth into the World, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad me <hi>To put off my Hat</hi> to any, <hi>High</hi> or <hi>Low.</hi> And I was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to <hi>Thee</hi> and <hi>Thou</hi> all Men and Women, without any reſpect to <hi>Rich</hi> or <hi>Poor, Great</hi> or <hi>Small.</hi> And as I traveled up and down, I was not to bid People <hi>Good Morrow,</hi> or <hi>Good Evening;</hi> neither might I <hi>Bow</hi> or <hi>Scrape with my Leg</hi> to any one: And this made the <hi>Sects</hi> and <hi>Profeſſions</hi> to rage. But the Lord's Power carried me over all to his Glory; and many came to be turned to God in a little time: For the heavenly <hi>Day</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> ſprang from on high, and brake forth apace; by the <hi>Light</hi> of which many came to ſee, where they were.</p>
            <p>But oh! the <hi>Rage</hi> that then was in the <hi>Prieſts, Magiſtrates, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors</hi> and <hi>People</hi> of all ſorts; but eſpecially in <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Profeſſors!</hi> For tho' <hi>Thou</hi> to a <hi>ſingle Perſon</hi> was according to their own Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, their <hi>Accidence</hi> and <hi>Grammar</hi> Rules, and according to the <hi>Bible;</hi> yet they could not bear to hear it: And the <hi>Hat-Honour,</hi> becauſe I could not <hi>put off</hi> my <hi>Hat</hi> to them, it ſet them all into a <hi>Rage.</hi> But the Lord ſhewed me, that it was an <hi>Honour below,</hi> which he would lay in the Duſt, and ſtain it; an <hi>Honour</hi> which <hi>proud Fleſh</hi> looked for, but ſought not the <hi>Honour,</hi> which came from <hi>God</hi> only. That it was an <hi>Honour</hi> invented by Men in the <hi>Fall,</hi> and in the Alienation from God, who were offended, if it were not given them; and yet would be looked upon themſelves as <hi>Saints, Church-members</hi> and great <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> But Chriſt ſaith, <hi>How can ye believe, who receive Honour one of another, and ſeek not the Honour, that cometh from God only? And I</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>receive not Honour of Men:</hi> Shewing, that Men have an <hi>Honour,</hi> which Men will <hi>receive</hi> and <hi>give;</hi> but Chriſt will have none of it: This is the <hi>Honour,</hi> which Chriſt will not receive, and which muſt be laid in the Duſt. Oh! the <hi>Rage</hi> and <hi>Scorn,</hi> the <hi>Heat</hi> and <hi>Fury</hi> that aroſe! Oh! the <hi>Blows, Punchings, Beatings</hi> and <hi>Impriſonments</hi> that we underwent, for <hi>not putting off our Hats</hi> to Men! For that ſoon tried all Mens Patience and Sobriety, what it was. Some had their <hi>Hats</hi> violently pluck'd off, and thrown away; ſo that they quite loſt them. The <hi>bad Language</hi> and <hi>evil <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage</hi> we received on this Account, is hard to be expreſſed; beſides the <hi>Danger</hi> we were ſometimes in of loſing our <hi>Lives</hi> for this Matter, and that by the great <hi>Profeſſors</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity;</hi> who thereby diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, that they were not true <hi>Believers.</hi> And though it was but a ſmall thing in the Eye of Man; yet a wonderful <hi>Confuſion</hi> it brought
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51448:47"/> among all <hi>Profeſſors</hi> and <hi>Prieſts:</hi> But, bleſſed be the Lord, many came to ſee the <hi>Vanity</hi> of that Cuſtom, of <hi>putting off the Hat</hi> to Men; and felt the weight of <hi>Truth's Teſtimony</hi> againſt it.</p>
            <p>About this time I was ſorely exerciſed in going to their <hi>Courts</hi> to cry for <hi>Juſtice,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1649"/> and in ſpeaking and writing to <hi>Judges</hi> and <hi>Juſtices</hi> to do <hi>Juſtly;</hi> and in warning ſuch, as kept <hi>publick Houſes</hi> for Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, that they ſhould not let People have more <hi>Drink,</hi> than would do them good: And in teſtifying againſt their <hi>Wakes</hi> or <hi>Feaſts,</hi> their <hi>May-Games, Sports, Plays</hi> and <hi>Shews,</hi> which trained up People to Vanity and Looſneſs, and led them from the fear of God; and the Days they had ſet forth for <hi>Holy-days,</hi> were uſually the times, wherein they moſt diſhonoured God by theſe things. In <hi>Fairs</hi> alſo, and in <hi>Markets</hi> I was made to declare againſt their <hi>deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Merchandize,</hi> and <hi>Cheating</hi> and <hi>Cozening;</hi> warning all to deal Juſtly, and to ſpeak the Truth, and to let their <hi>Yea</hi> be <hi>yea,</hi> and their <hi>Nay</hi> be <hi>nay;</hi> and to do unto others, as they would have others do unto them: And fore-warning them of the <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Terrible Day</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> which would come upon them all. I was moved alſo to Cry againſt all ſorts of <hi>Muſick,</hi> and againſt the <hi>Mountebanes</hi> playing <hi>Tricks</hi> on their <hi>Stages;</hi> for they burdened the pure Life, and ſtirred up Peoples Minds to Vanity. I was much exerciſed too with <hi>School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters</hi> and <hi>School-miſtreſſes,</hi> warning them to teach their Children Sobriety in the fear of the Lord; that they might not be nurſed and trained up in <hi>Lightneſs, Vanity</hi> and <hi>Wantonneſs.</hi> Likewiſe I was made to warn <hi>Maſters</hi> and <hi>Miſtreſſes, Fathers</hi> and <hi>Mothers</hi> in private Families, to take care, that their <hi>Children</hi> and <hi>Servants</hi> might be trained up in the <hi>fear</hi> of the <hi>Lord;</hi> and that they themſelves ſhould be therein <hi>Examples</hi> and <hi>Patterns</hi> of Sobriety and Vertue to them. For I ſaw, that, as the <hi>Jews</hi> were to teach their Children the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Old Covenant,</hi> and to train them up in it; and their <hi>Servants,</hi> yea the very <hi>Strangers,</hi> were to keep the <hi>Sabbath</hi> amongſt them, and be <hi>Circumciſed,</hi> before they might eat of their Sacrifices; ſo all <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and all that made a <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> ought to Train up their <hi>Children</hi> and <hi>Servants</hi> in the New Covenant of <hi>Light,</hi> Chriſt Jeſus, who is God's Salvation to the Ends of the Earth; that all may know their Salvation. And they ought to train them up in the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Love</hi> and of <hi>Faith;</hi> that they might be made free from the <hi>Law</hi> of Sin and Death. And all Chriſtians ought to be <hi>Circumciſed</hi> by the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> which puts off the Body of the <hi>Sins</hi> of the Fleſh, that they may come to Eat of the heavenly <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> Chriſt Jeſus, that true ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Food, which none can, rightly feed upon, but they, that are <hi>Circumciſed</hi> by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> Likewiſe I was Exerciſed about the <hi>Star-Gazers,</hi> who drew Peoples Minds from Chriſt, the bright and the <hi>Morning-Star;</hi> and from the Sun of <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> by whom the <hi>Sun,</hi> and <hi>Moon</hi> and <hi>Stars,</hi> and all things elſe were made, who is the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and from whom the right Knowledge of all things is received.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>black, Earthly Spirit</hi> of the <hi>Prieſt</hi> wounded my Life: And when I heard the <hi>Bell toll,</hi> to call People together to the <hi>Steeple-houſe,</hi> it ſtruck at my Life: For it was juſt like a <hi>Market-Bell,</hi> to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51448:48"/> gather People together,<note place="margin">1649.

Notwithſtanding that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> were given forth <hi>freely;</hi> and Chriſt commanded his Miniſters to <hi>Preach freely;</hi> and the Prophets and Apoſtles denounced Judgment againſt all <hi>Covetous Hirelings,</hi> and <hi>Diviners</hi> for <hi>Money.</hi> But in this <hi>free Spirit</hi> of the Lord Jeſus was I ſent forth, to declare the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> and Reconciliation <hi>freely,</hi> that all might come up to Chriſt, who gives <hi>freely,</hi> and who renews up into the Image of God, which Man and Woman were in, before they fell; that they might ſit down in the heavenly Places in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>

               <note place="margin">Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</note>Now as I went towards <hi>Nottingham</hi> on a <hi>Firſt-day</hi> in the Morning, with <hi>Friends</hi> to a <hi>Meeting</hi> there, when I came on top of a Hill, in ſight of the Town, I eſpied the great <hi>Steeple-houſe;</hi> and the Lord ſaid unto me; <hi>Thou must go cry against yonder great Idol, and against the Worſhippers therein.</hi> So I ſaid nothing of this to the <hi>Friends,</hi> that were with me; but went on with them to the <hi>Meeting,</hi> where the mighty Power of the Lord God was amongſt us: In which I left <hi>Friends</hi> ſitting in the <hi>Meeting;</hi> and I went away to the <hi>Steeple-houſe.</hi> And when I came there, all the People looked, like <hi>Fallow Ground;</hi> and the <hi>Prieſt</hi> (like a great <hi>Lump</hi> of <hi>Earth</hi>) ſtood in his <hi>Pulpit</hi> above: And he took for his <hi>Text</hi> theſe Words of <hi>Peter, [We have alſo a more ſure Word of Prophecy, whereunto ye do well, that ye take heed, as unto a Light, that ſhineth in a dark Place, until the day dawn, and the Day-ſtar ariſe in your Hearts.]</hi> And he told the People, that this was the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> by which they were to <hi>Try</hi> all <hi>Doctrines, Religions</hi> and <hi>Opinions.</hi> Now the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> was ſo mighty upon me, and ſo ſtrong in me, that I could not hold; but was made to cry out, and ſay; <hi>Oh no, It is not the Scriptures.</hi> But I told them what it was, namely the <hi>Holy Spirit;</hi> by which the Holy Men of God gave forth the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> whereby <hi>Opinions, Religions</hi> and <hi>Judgments</hi> were to be <hi>tried:</hi> For it led into all Truth, and ſo gave the knowledge of all <hi>Truth.</hi> For the <hi>Jews</hi> had the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and yet reſiſted the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and rejected Chriſt, the bright <hi>Morning-Star;</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and took upon them to <hi>Try</hi> their <hi>Doctrines</hi> by the <hi>Scriptures;</hi> but erred in <hi>Judgment,</hi> and did not <hi>try</hi> them a-right; becauſe they <hi>tried</hi> without the Holy Ghoſt. Now as I ſpake thus amongſt them, the <hi>Officers</hi> came, and took me away, and put me into a <hi>naſty, ſtinking Priſon;</hi> the ſmell whereof got ſo into my Noſe and Throat, that it very much annoyed me.</p>
            <p>But that day the <hi>Lord's Power ſounded</hi> ſo in their <hi>Ears,</hi> that they were amazed at the <hi>Voice,</hi> and could not get it out of their Ears for ſome time after; they were ſo reached by the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> in the <hi>Steeple-houſe.</hi> At Night they took me out of <hi>Priſon,</hi> and had me before the <hi>Major, Aldermen</hi> and <hi>Sheriffs</hi> of the Town: And when I was brought before them, the <hi>Major</hi> was in a peeviſh, fretful Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; but the Lord's Power allay'd him. Then they examined me at large; and I told them, how the <hi>Lord</hi> had moved me to come. Then, after ſome Diſcourſe had paſſed between them and

               <note place="margin">☜</note> And ſhe took me by the Hand, and was much wrought upon by the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> God: And her <hi>Husband,</hi> and <hi>Children,</hi> and <hi>Servants</hi> were much changed; for the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> wrought upon them. And I lodged at the <hi>Sheriff's</hi> Houſe, and great <hi>Meetings</hi> we had in his Houſe; and ſome <hi>Perſons</hi> of conſiderable Condition in the World came to them, and the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> appeared eminently amongſt them. And this <hi>Sheriff</hi> ſent for the other <hi>Sheriff,</hi> and for a <hi>Woman,</hi> they had had Dealings with in way of Trade; and he told her before the other <hi>Sheriff,</hi> that they had <hi>wronged her in their Dealings</hi> with her (for the other <hi>Sheriff</hi> and he were <hi>Partners</hi>) and that they ought to make her Reſtitution: This he ſpake chearfully. But the other <hi>Sheriff</hi> denied it; and the <hi>Woman</hi> ſaid, She knew nothing of it. But the friendly <hi>Sheriff</hi> ſaid, it was ſo; and that the <hi>other</hi> knew it well enough: And then having diſcovered the Matter, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the <hi>Wrong</hi> done by them, he made <hi>Reſtitution</hi> to the Woman; and exhorted the other <hi>Sheriff</hi> to do the like. And the Lord's Power was with this <hi>Friendly Sheriff,</hi> and wrought a mighty Change in him; and great Openings he had. And on the next <hi>Market-day</hi> following, as he was walking with me in the Chamber, in his Slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, he ſaid, <hi>I must go into the Market, and preach Repentance to the People:</hi> And accordingly he went in his Slippers into the <hi>Market,</hi> and into ſeveral Streets, and preached <hi>Repentance</hi> to the People. Several others alſo in the Town were moved to ſpeak to the <hi>Major</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates,</hi> and to the <hi>People,</hi> exhorting them to <hi>Repent.</hi> Hereupon the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> grew very Angry, and ſent for me from the <hi>Sheriff's</hi> Houſe, and Committed me to the Common <hi>Priſon.</hi>

At which, I underſtood, the <hi>Judge</hi> was ſomewhat offended, and ſaid; <hi>He would have admoniſhed the Youth, if he had been brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him:</hi> For I was then <hi>Impriſoned</hi> by the Name of <hi>A YO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>TH.</hi> So I was returned to <hi>Priſon</hi> again, and put into the <hi>Common Goal.</hi> And the Lord's Power was great among <hi>Friends;</hi> but the People began to be very <hi>Rude:</hi> Wherefore the <hi>Governour</hi> of the <hi>Caſtle</hi> ſent down <hi>Souldiers,</hi> and diſperſed them; and after that they were quiet. But both <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>People</hi> were aſtoniſhed at the wonderful <hi>Power,</hi> that brake forth: And ſeveral of the <hi>Prieſts</hi> were made tender, and ſome did Confeſs to the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Lord.</hi>

            <p>Now, after I was ſet at Liberty from <hi>Nottingham-Goal</hi> (where I had been kept <hi>Priſoner</hi> a pretty long time) I traveled, as before, in the <hi>Work</hi> of the <hi>Lord.</hi> And coming to <hi>Mansfield-Woodhouſe,</hi>

            <p>Now while I was at <hi>Mansfield-Woodhouſe,</hi> I was moved to go to to the <hi>Steeple-houſe</hi> there, and declare the <hi>Truth</hi> to the <hi>Prieſt</hi> and <hi>People.</hi> But the People fell upon me in great <hi>Rage,</hi> and ſtruck me down, and almoſt <hi>ſtifled</hi> and <hi>ſmothered</hi> me; and I was cruelly <hi>beaten</hi> and <hi>bruiſed</hi> by them with their <hi>Hands, Bibles</hi> and <hi>Sticks.</hi> Then they haled me out (though I was hardly able to ſtand) and put me into the <hi>Stocks,</hi> where I ſate ſome <hi>Hours;</hi> and they brought <hi>Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whips</hi> and <hi>Horſe-whips,</hi> threatning to <hi>Whip</hi> me.

And there were ſome <hi>Baptiſts</hi> in that Country, whom I deſired to ſee and ſpeak with; becauſe they were <hi>ſeparated</hi> from the <hi>publick Worſhip.</hi> So one <hi>Oats,</hi> who was one of their Chief <hi>Teachers,</hi> and others of the <hi>Heads</hi> of them, with ſeveral others of their Company,<note place="margin">Barrow.</note> came to <hi>Meet</hi> us at <hi>Barrow;</hi> and there we diſcourſed with them.

So after we had had ſome Diſcourſe together, we parted; and ſome of them were lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to us.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>Firſt Day</hi> of the <hi>Week</hi> following we came to <hi>Bagworth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bagworth.</note> and went to a <hi>Steeple-Houſe,</hi> where ſome <hi>Friends</hi> were got in; and the People locked them in, and themſelves too, with the <hi>Prieſt.</hi> But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Prieſt</hi> had done, they opened the Door, and we went in alſo; and had a <hi>Service</hi> for the <hi>Lord</hi> amongſt them. Afterwards we had a <hi>Meeting</hi> in the Town, amongſt ſeveral People that were in high Notions. Then paſſing from thence, I heard of a People, that were in <hi>Priſon</hi> in <hi>Coventry</hi> for <hi>Religion.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Coventry.</note> And as I walked towards the <hi>Jail,</hi> the <hi>Word</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> came to me, ſaying;<note place="margin">☜</note> 
               <hi>MY LOVE WAS ALWAYS TO THEE, AND THO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g> ART IN MY LOVE.</hi> And I was raviſhed with the Senſe of the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and greatly ſtrengthned in my Inward Man. But when I came into the <hi>Jail,</hi> where thoſe <hi>Priſoners</hi> were, a great <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Darkneſs</hi> ſtruck at me; and I ſate ſtill, having my Spirit gathered into the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> At laſt theſe <hi>Priſoners</hi> began to <hi>Rant,</hi> and <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour,</hi> and <hi>Blaſpheme;</hi> at which my Soul was greatly grieved. They ſaid, They were <hi>GOD:</hi> But another of them ſaid, We could not <hi>bear</hi> ſuch Things. So, when they were calm, I ſtood up and asked them, Whether they did ſuch things by <hi>Motion,</hi> or from <hi>Scripture?</hi> and they ſaid; <hi>from Scripture.</hi> Then, a <hi>Bible</hi> lying by, I asked them for that <hi>Scripture;</hi> and they ſhewed me that Place, where the <hi>Sheet was let down</hi> to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and it was ſaid to him, What was <hi>ſanctified,</hi> he ſhould not call <hi>Common</hi> or <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean.</hi> Now, when I had ſhewed them, That that <hi>Scripture</hi> made nothing for their purpoſe; they brought another <hi>Scripture,</hi> which ſpake of <hi>God's Reconciling all Things to himſelf, Things in Heaven, and Things in Earth.</hi> I told them, I owned that <hi>Scripture</hi> alſo; but ſhewed them, that that was nothing to their purpoſe neither: Then ſeeing they ſaid, They were <hi>GOD,</hi> I asked them, If they knew, whether it would Rain to Morrow? They ſaid, <hi>They could not tell.</hi> I told them, <hi>God</hi> could tell. Again, I asked them; If they thought, they ſhould be always in that Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or ſhould change?

So they were Confounded, and quite brought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>own for the time. Then after I had Reproved them for their <hi>blaſphemous Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,</hi> I went away: For I perceived, they were <hi>Ranters;</hi> and I had met with none before: And I admired the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> in appearing ſo unto me, before I went amongſt them. Not long after
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51448:50"/> this,<note place="margin">1649. Coventry.</note> one of theſe <hi>Ranters,</hi> whoſe Name was <hi>Joſeph Salmon,</hi> put forth a <hi>Paper,</hi> or <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Recantation;</hi> upon which they were ſet at Liberty.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Ather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone.</note>From <hi>Coventry</hi> I went to a Place called <hi>Atherſtone;</hi> and it being their <hi>Lecture-day,</hi> I was moved to go to their <hi>Chappel</hi> to ſpeak to the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>People:</hi> And they were generally pretty quiet; Only ſome few raged, and would have had my <hi>Relations</hi> to have <hi>bound</hi> me. I declared largely to them, how that <hi>God</hi> was come to <hi>Teach</hi> his People himſelf, and to bring them off from all their <hi>Man-made Teachers,</hi> to hear his <hi>Son:</hi> And ſome were <hi>Convinced</hi> there.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Market-Boſſoth.</note>Then went I to a Place called <hi>Market-Boſſoth,</hi> and there was a <hi>Lecture</hi> there alſo. And he that preached there that day, was <hi>Natha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel Stevens,</hi> who was <hi>Prieſt</hi> of the Town, where I was born. And he raged much, when I ſpake to him and to the People; and told the People, I was <hi>Mad:</hi> (tho' he had ſaid before to one <hi>Colonel Purfoy,</hi> That <hi>there was never ſuch a Plant bred in</hi> England;) and he bid the People, they ſhould not hear me. So the People, being ſtirred up by this deceitful <hi>Prieſt,</hi> fell upon us, and <hi>ſtoned</hi> us out of the Town: Yet they did not do us much hurt. Howbeit ſome People were made <hi>Loving</hi> that day; and others were <hi>Confirmed,</hi> ſeeing the Rage of both <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Profeſſors:</hi> And ſome cried out, that the <hi>Prieſt</hi> durſt not ſtand to prove his <hi>Miniſtry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as I traveled through <hi>Markets, Fairs</hi> and divers <hi>Places,</hi> I ſaw <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Darkneſs</hi> in all People, where the Power of the Lord God had not ſhaken them.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Leiceſter-ſhire.</hi> Twy-Croſs.</note> And as I was paſſing on in <hi>Leiceſter-ſhire,</hi> I came to a Place called <hi>Twy-Croſs,</hi> where there were <hi>Exciſe-Men;</hi> and I was moved of the Lord to go to them, and warn them to take heed of <hi>Oppreſſing</hi> the <hi>Poor:</hi> And People were much affected with it. Now there was in that <hi>Town</hi> a <hi>great Man,</hi> that had long lain <hi>ſick,</hi> and was given over by the <hi>Phyſicians;</hi> and ſome <hi>Friends</hi> in the Town deſired me to go to ſee him. And I went up to him in his Chamber, and ſpake the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> to him, and was moved to <hi>Pray</hi> by him; and the <hi>Lord</hi> was entreated, and <hi>Reſtored him to Health.</hi> But when I was come down the Stairs, into a <hi>lower Room,</hi> and was ſpeaking to the <hi>Servants,</hi> and to ſome People that were there; a <hi>Serving-Man</hi> of his came Raving out of another Room, with a <hi>naked Rapier</hi> in his Hand, and ſet it juſt to my ſide. But I looked ſtedfaſtly on him, and ſaid; <hi>Alack for thee, poor Creature! what wilt thou do with thy carnal Weapon? It is no more to me, than a Straw.</hi> The Standers by were much troubled, and he went away in a Rage, and full of Wrath: But when the News of it came to his <hi>Maſter,</hi> he turned him out of his Service. Thus the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> preſerved me, and raiſed up the <hi>Weak Man;</hi> who afterwards was very Loving to <hi>Friends:</hi> And when I came to that Town again, both he and his Wife came to ſee me.</p>
            <p>After this I was moved to go into <hi>Darbyſhire,</hi> where the mighty <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God</hi> was among <hi>Friends.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Darbyſhire.</hi> Cheſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field.</note> And I went to <hi>Cheſterfield,</hi> where one <hi>Britland</hi> was <hi>Prieſt.</hi> He was one, that ſaw beyond the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort of <hi>Prieſts;</hi> for he had been partly <hi>Convinced,</hi> and had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken much on behalf of <hi>Truth,</hi> before he was <hi>Prieſt</hi> there: But when the <hi>Prieſt</hi> of that Town died, he got the <hi>Parſonage,</hi> and choked
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51448:50"/> himſelf with it.<note place="margin">1649. Cheſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field.</note> So I was moved to ſpeak to him and the People in the great <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> that they might come off from all <hi>Mens Teaching</hi> unto <hi>God's Teaching;</hi> and he was not able to gainſay. But they had me before the <hi>Major,</hi> and threatned to ſend me, with ſome others, to the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Correction;</hi> and kept us in <hi>Cuſtody,</hi> till it was late in the Night: And then the <hi>Officers,</hi> with the <hi>Watchmen,</hi> put us out of the Town, leaving us to ſhift, as we could. So I bent my Courſe towards <hi>Darby,</hi> having a <hi>Friend</hi> or two with me: And in our way we met with many <hi>Profeſſors;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Kidſey-park.</note> and at <hi>Kidſey-Park</hi> many were <hi>Convinced.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then coming to <hi>Darby,</hi> I lay at a <hi>Doctor's</hi> Houſe,<note place="margin">1650. Darby.</note> whoſe <hi>Wife</hi> was <hi>Convinced;</hi> and ſo were ſeveral more in the Town. And as I was walking in my Chamber, the <hi>Bell rung;</hi> and it ſtruck at my Life at the very hearing of it. So I asked the Woman of the Houſe, <hi>What the Bell rung for?</hi> And ſhe ſaid, There was to be a great <hi>Lecture</hi> there that day, and many of the <hi>Officers</hi> of the <hi>Army,</hi> and <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Preachers</hi> were to be there that Day, and a <hi>Colonel,</hi> that was a <hi>Preacher.</hi> Then was I moved of the <hi>Lord</hi> to go up to them: And when they had done, I ſpake to them, what the <hi>Lord</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me; and they were pretty quiet. But there came an <hi>Officer,</hi> and took me by the Hand, and ſaid, I muſt go before the <hi>Magiſtrates;</hi> and the other <hi>Two</hi> that were with me. It was about the <hi>Firſt Hour Afternoon,</hi> that we came before them. They asked me, Why we came thither? I ſaid, God moved us ſo to do; and I told them, <hi>God dwells not in Temples made with Hands.</hi> I told them alſo, All their <hi>Preaching, Baptiſm</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices</hi> would never ſanctifie them; and bid them, Look unto <hi>Christ in them,</hi> and not unto Men: For it is <hi>Christ,</hi> that ſanctifies. Then they ran into many Words; but I told them, They were not to <hi>Diſpute</hi> of God and Chriſt, but to <hi>Obey</hi> him. And <hi>the Power of God thundred amongſt them, and they did fly like Chaff before it.</hi> They put me in and out of the Room often, hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying me backward and forward often: For they were from the <hi>Firſt Hour</hi> till the <hi>Ninth</hi> at Night in Examining me. And ſometimes they would tell me in a deriding manner, <hi>That I was taken up in Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi> At laſt they asked me, <hi>Whether I was Sanctified?</hi> I anſwered, <hi>Yes;</hi> for I was in the <hi>Paradiſe</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> Then they asked me, <hi>If I had no Sin?</hi> I anſwered; Chriſt my Saviour has taken away my <hi>Sin;</hi> and in him there is no <hi>Sin.</hi> They asked, <hi>How we knew, that Chriſt did abide in us?</hi> I ſaid, by his <hi>Spirit,</hi> that he hath given us. They temptingly asked, <hi>If any of us were Chriſt?</hi> I anſwered, <hi>NAY,</hi>
               <note place="margin">☜</note> we were nothing; Chriſt was all. They ſaid, <hi>If a Man ſteal, is it no Sin?</hi> I anſwered; All Unrighteouſneſs is Sin. So when they had wearied themſelves in Examining me, they Committed me and one other Man to the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Correction</hi> in <hi>Darby</hi> for <hi>ſix Months,</hi> as <hi>Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers;</hi> as may appear by the <hi>Mittimus,</hi> a Copy whereof here followeth:

            <p>Now did the <hi>Prieſts</hi> beſtir themſelves in their <hi>Pulpits</hi> to preach up <hi>Sin for term of Life;</hi> and much of their Work was, to plead for it: So that People ſaid, <hi>Never was the like heard.</hi> Then after ſome time, he that was <hi>Committed</hi> with me, not ſtanding faithful in his <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> got in with the <hi>Jailer,</hi> and by him made way to the <hi>Juſtice</hi> to have leave to go ſee his Mother; and ſo got his Liberty.

               <q>He confeſſed alſo to me; that at thoſe Times, when I had asked him to let me go forth, to ſpeak the <hi>Word</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> to the People, and he had refuſed to let me go, and I had laid the <hi>weight</hi> thereof upon him, that then he uſed to be under great <hi>Trouble,</hi> amazed and almoſt diſtracted for ſome time after; and in ſuch a Condition, that he had little Strength left him.</q> When the Morning came, he aroſe, and ſoon after went to the <hi>Juſtices,</hi> and told them; <hi>That he and his Houſe had been plagued for my ſake:</hi> and one of the <hi>Juſtices</hi> replied (as he reported to me) that the <hi>Plagues</hi> were on them too, for keeping me.

            <p>After this the <hi>Juſtices</hi> gave leave, <hi>That I ſhould have Liberty to walk a Mile.</hi> I perceived their End; and I told the <hi>Jailer, If they would ſet down to me, how far a</hi> Mile <hi>was, I might take the liberty of walking it ſometimes:</hi> For I had a Senſe, they thought, I would go away.

            <p>Now foraſmuch as, by reaſon of my <hi>Reſtraint,</hi> I had not the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of <hi>Traveling</hi> about, to declare and ſpread <hi>Truth</hi> through the <hi>Countries;</hi> it came upon me to Write a <hi>Paper,</hi> and ſend it forth to be ſpread abroad both amongſt <hi>Friends,</hi> and other tender People, for the Opening of their Underſtandings in the <hi>Way</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> and directing them to the true <hi>Teacher</hi> in themſelves.

Now <hi>Love</hi> begetteth <hi>Love,</hi> its own Nature and Image: And when <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> do meet, what Joy there is! And <hi>Mercy</hi> doth Triumph in <hi>Judgment:</hi> And <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> doth bear the <hi>Judgment</hi> of the <hi>World</hi> in patience.

So the <hi>fleſhly Mind</hi> doth mind the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and talketh <hi>fleſhly,</hi> and its Knowledge is <hi>fleſhly,</hi> and not ſpiritual; but ſavours of <hi>Death,</hi> and not of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Life.</hi> Now ſome Men have the Nature of <hi>Swine,</hi> wallowing in the <hi>Mire:</hi> And ſome Men have the Nature of <hi>Dogs,</hi> to bite both the <hi>Sheep</hi> and one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And ſome Men have the Nature of <hi>Lions,</hi> to tear, devour and deſtroy: And ſome Men have the Nature of <hi>Wolves,</hi> to tear and devour the Lambs and Sheep of Chriſt: And ſome Men have the Nature of the <hi>Serpent</hi> (that old Adverſary) to ſting, envenom and poiſon: <hi>He that hath an Ear to hear, let him hear,</hi> and learn theſe things within himſelf.

            <p>While I was yet in the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Correction,</hi> there came unto me a <hi>Trooper,</hi> and ſaid; As he was ſitting in the <hi>Steeple-houſe,</hi> hearing the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> exceeding great <hi>Trouble</hi> came upon him; and the Voice of the <hi>Lord</hi> came to him ſaying; <hi>Doſt thou not know,</hi>
               <note place="margin">☜</note> 
               <hi>that my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant is in</hi> Priſon? <hi>Go to him for direction.</hi> So I ſpake to his Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and his Underſtanding was opened. And I told him; That which ſhewed him his <hi>Sins,</hi> and troubled him for them, would ſhew him his <hi>Salvation:</hi> For he that ſhews a Man his <hi>Sin,</hi> is the ſame, that takes it away. Now, while I was ſpeaking to him, the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> opened him, ſo that he began to have a good Underſtanding in the <hi>Lord's Truth,</hi> and to be ſenſible of <hi>God's Mercies;</hi> and began to ſpeak boldly in his <hi>Quarters</hi> amongſt the <hi>Souldiers,</hi> and to others, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Truth</hi> (for the <hi>Scriptures</hi> were very much opened to him) inſomuch that he ſaid; <hi>His</hi> Colonel <hi>was as Blind as</hi> Nebuchadnezar, <hi>to caſt the Servant of the Lord into Priſon.</hi> Upon this his <hi>Colonel</hi> had a <hi>Spight</hi> at him; and at <hi>Worceſter</hi>-Fight, the Year after, when, the <hi>Two Armies</hi> lying near one another, <hi>Two</hi> came out from the <hi>King's Army,</hi> and challenged any <hi>Two</hi> of the <hi>Parliament-Army</hi> to fight with them; his <hi>Colonel</hi> made Choice of him and another, to Anſwer the <hi>Challenge.</hi> And when in the Encounter his <hi>Companion</hi> was <hi>ſlain,</hi> he drave <hi>both</hi> his <hi>Enemies</hi> within Muſquet-ſhot of the Town, without firing a <hi>Piſtol</hi> at them: This, when he returned, he told me with his own Mouth. But when the <hi>Fight</hi> was over, he ſaw the <hi>Deceit</hi> and <hi>Hypocriſy</hi> of the <hi>Officers:</hi> And being ſenſible, how wonderfully the <hi>Lord</hi> had <hi>preſerved</hi> him, and ſeeing alſo to the End of <hi>Fighting,</hi> he <hi>laid down</hi> his <hi>Arms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Time of my Commitment to the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Correction</hi> being very neat out, and there being many new <hi>Souldiers</hi> Raiſed, the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> would have made me <hi>Captain</hi> over them: And the <hi>Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers</hi> cried, <hi>They would have none but me.</hi> So the <hi>Keeper</hi> of the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:51448:58"/> 
               <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Correction</hi> was Commanded to bring me up before the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners</hi> and <hi>Souldiers,</hi> in the <hi>Market-place;</hi> and there they proffered me that <hi>Preferment</hi> (as they called it) asking me, If I would not take up <hi>Arms</hi> for the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> againſt <hi>Charles Steward?</hi> I told them, <q>I knew, from whence all <hi>Wars</hi> did ariſe, even from the <hi>Luſt,</hi> according to <hi>James</hi> his Doctrine: and that I lived in the Vertue of that <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> that took away the Occaſion of all <hi>Wars.</hi>
               </q> But they courted me to accept of their Offer, and thought, I did but Complement with them. But I told them, <q>I was come into the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> which was before <hi>Wars</hi> and <hi>Strifes</hi> were.</q> They ſaid, They offered it in <hi>Love and Kindneſs to me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of my Vertue;</hi> and ſuch like flattering Words they uſed. But I told them, <q>If that was their <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Kindneſs,</hi> I trampled it under my Feet.</q> Then their Rage got up, and they ſaid; <hi>Take him away Jailer, and put him into the</hi> Dungeon <hi>amongſt the Rogues and Fellons.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Darby-Dungeon.</note> So I was had away and put into a <hi>louſy, ſtinking Place,</hi> without any Bed, amongſt <hi>thirty Fellons;</hi> where I was kept almoſt <hi>half a Year,</hi> unleſs it were at Times: For they would ſometime let me walk in the <hi>Garden,</hi> having a Belief of me, that I would not go away. Now, when they had gotten me into <hi>Darby-Dungeon,</hi> it was the Belief and ſaying of People, that I ſhould never come out: But I had <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>God,</hi> and believed, I ſhould be delivered in his Time: For the <hi>Lord</hi> had ſaid to me before, That <hi>I was not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from that Place yet, being ſet there for a</hi> Service, <hi>which he had for me to do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After it was bruited abroad, That I was in <hi>Darby-Dungeon,</hi> my <hi>Relations</hi> came to ſee me again; and they were much troubled, that I ſhould be in <hi>Priſon:</hi> For they looked upon it, to be a great ſhame to them, for me to lie in <hi>Jail.</hi> It was a ſtrange thing then, to be <hi>Impriſoned</hi> for <hi>Religion:</hi> And ſome thought, I was <hi>Mad,</hi> becauſe I ſtood for <hi>Purity,</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>Perfection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Among others that came to ſee me, and diſcourſe with me, there came a certain <hi>Perſon</hi> from <hi>Nottingham,</hi> a <hi>Souldier,</hi> and that had been a <hi>Baptiſt</hi> (as I underſtood) and with him came ſeveral others. And in Diſcourſe this <hi>Perſon</hi> ſaid to me, <hi>Your Faith ſtands in a Man, that died at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and there was never any ſuch thing.</hi> I was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly grieved, to hear him ſay ſo; and I ſaid to him: How! Did nor Chriſt ſuffer without the <hi>Gates</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> through the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Chief Prieſts,</hi> and <hi>Pilate?</hi> And he denied, that ever Chriſt ſuffered there outwardly. Then I asked him, Whether there were not <hi>Chief Prieſts,</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Pilat</hi> there outwardly? And when he could not deny that, then I told him: As certainly as there was a <hi>Chief Prieſt,</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Pilat</hi> there outwardly; ſo certainly was Chriſt <hi>perſecuted</hi> by them, and did <hi>ſuffer</hi> there out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly under them. Yet from this Man's Words was a <hi>Slander</hi> raiſed upon us, That the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſhould <hi>deny Chriſt, that ſuffered and died at</hi> Jeruſalem: Which was all utterly falſe; and the leaſt Thought of it never entred our Hearts; but it was a meer <hi>Slander</hi> caſt upon us, and occaſioned by this <hi>Perſon's</hi> Words. The ſame <hi>Perſon</hi> alſo ſaid; <hi>That never any of the Prophets, nor Apoſtles, nor Holy Men of God ſuffered any thing Outwardly; but all their DunSufferings
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:51448:58"/> were Inward.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1651. Darby-Dungeon.</note> But I inſtanced to him many of the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> how they ſuffered, and by whom they ſuffered: And ſo was the Power of the Lord brought over his <hi>wicked Imaginations</hi> and <hi>Whimſies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There came alſo another <hi>Company</hi> to me, that pretended, They were <hi>Triers of Spirits:</hi> And I asked them; What was the <hi>firſt Step</hi> to <hi>Peace?</hi> And what it was, by which a Man might ſee his <hi>Salvation?</hi> And they were preſently up in the airy Mind, and ſaid, I was <hi>Mad.</hi> Thus they came to <hi>Try Spirits,</hi> who did not know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor their own <hi>Spirits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Time of my <hi>Impriſonment,</hi> I was exceedingly exerciſed about the Proceedings of the <hi>Judges</hi> and <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> in their <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Judicature.</hi> And I was moved to write to the <hi>Judges,</hi> concerning their putting Men to <hi>Death</hi> for <hi>Cattel,</hi> and <hi>Money,</hi> and ſmall Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and to ſhew them, how Contrary it was to the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in old Time: for I was under great Suffering in my Spirit becauſe of it, and under the very <hi>Senſe</hi> of <hi>Death;</hi> but ſtanding in the <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> an heavenly Breathing aroſe in my Soul to the <hi>Lord.</hi> Then did I ſee the Heavens opened, and I rejoiced, and gave Glory to God. So I writ to the <hi>Judges,</hi> as followeth:</p>
            <q>
               <p>I Am moved to write unto you to take heed, of putting Men to <hi>Death</hi> for ſtealing <hi>Cattel,</hi> or <hi>Money,</hi> &amp;c. for the <hi>Thieves</hi> in the old Time were to make <hi>Reſtitution;</hi> and if they had not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, they were to be <hi>ſold</hi> for their <hi>Theft.</hi> Mind the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi> that gave them forth; and let them be your <hi>Rule</hi> in executing <hi>Judgment:</hi> And ſhew <hi>Mercy,</hi> that you may receive <hi>Mercy</hi> from God, the <hi>Judge</hi> of all. And take heed of <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Rewards,</hi> and of <hi>Pride;</hi> for God doth forbid them, and they do blind the <hi>Eyes</hi> of the <hi>Wiſe.</hi> I do not write to give liberty to <hi>Sin;</hi> God hath forbidden it: But that you ſhould <hi>Judge</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his <hi>Laws,</hi> and ſhew <hi>Mercy:</hi> For he delighteth in true <hi>Judgment,</hi> and in <hi>Mercy.</hi> I beſeech you to mind theſe Things, and <hi>prize</hi> your <hi>Time,</hi> now you have it; and <hi>Fear God,</hi> and <hi>Serve</hi> him: for he is a <hi>Conſuming Fire.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>Beſides this, I writ another <hi>Letter</hi> to the JUDGES, to this effect:</p>
            <q>
               <p>I Am moved to write unto you, That ye do true <hi>Juſtice</hi> to every Man, and ſee, that none be <hi>Oppreſſed,</hi> nor <hi>Wronged;</hi> nor no <hi>Oaths</hi> Impoſed: for the Land mourneth becauſe of <hi>Oaths,</hi> and <hi>Adulteries,</hi> and <hi>Sorceries,</hi> and <hi>Drunkenneſs,</hi> and <hi>Prophaneneſs.</hi> O Conſider, ye that be Men ſet in <hi>Authority:</hi> Be moderate, and in <hi>Lowlineſs</hi> Conſider theſe things.

               </p>
            </q>
            <p>Moreover, I laid before the <hi>Judges,</hi> what an hurtful thing it was, that <hi>Priſoners</hi> ſhould lie ſo long in <hi>Jail;</hi> ſhewing, how that they learned <hi>Badneſs</hi> one of another, in talking of their <hi>bad Deeds:</hi> and therefore <hi>ſpeedy Juſtice</hi> ſhould be done. For I was a tender <hi>Youth,</hi> and dwelt in the <hi>Fear</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> and I was grieved to hear their <hi>bad Language;</hi> and was often made to reprove them for their <hi>wicked Words,</hi> and <hi>evil Carriage</hi> towards each other. And People did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, that I was ſo preſerved and Kept; for they could never catch a <hi>Word</hi> or <hi>Action</hi> from me, to make any thing of againſt me, all the time, that I was there: For the <hi>Lord's Infinite Power</hi> upheld and preſerved me all that time; to him be <hi>Praiſes</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> for ever!</p>
            <p>Now, while I was here in <hi>Priſon,</hi> there was a <hi>young-Woman</hi> in the <hi>Jail</hi> for <hi>Robbing</hi> her Maſter of ſome Money: and when ſhe was to be <hi>Tried</hi> for her <hi>Life,</hi> I writ to the <hi>Judge</hi> and to the <hi>Jury</hi> about her, ſhewing them; How contrary it was to the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in old Time, to put People to <hi>Death</hi> for <hi>Stealing:</hi> and moving them to ſhew <hi>Mercy.</hi> Yet ſhe was <hi>Condemned to die,</hi> and a <hi>Grave</hi> was made for her; and at the Time appointed, ſhe was carried forth to <hi>Execution.</hi> Then I writ a few Words, <q>Warning all People to beware of <hi>Greedineſs</hi> or <hi>Covetouſneſs,</hi> for it leads from <hi>God;</hi> but that all ſhould <hi>Fear</hi> the <hi>Lord,</hi> and avoid all <hi>Earthly Luſts,</hi> and prize their Time, while they have it: This I gave to be read at the <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</hi>
               </q> And though they had her upon the <hi>Ladder,</hi> with a <hi>Cloath</hi> bound over her Face, ready to be turned off; yet they did not put her to <hi>Death,</hi> but brought her back again to <hi>Priſon:</hi> And in the <hi>Priſon</hi> ſhe afterwards came to be <hi>Convinced</hi> of God's Everlaſting <hi>Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was alſo in the <hi>Jail,</hi> while I was there, a <hi>Priſoner,</hi> a <hi>Wicked, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly Man,</hi> who was reputed a <hi>Conjurer;</hi> and he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, how he would talk with me, and what he would do to me: but he never had Power to open his Mouth to me. And on a time, the <hi>Jailer</hi> and he falling out, he threatned the <hi>Jailer,</hi> That he would <hi>Raiſe the Devil, and break his Houſe down;</hi> ſo that he made the <hi>Jai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi> afraid. Then I was moved of the <hi>Lord,</hi> to go in his Power, and <hi>Rebuke</hi> him in it; and to ſay unto him: <hi>Come let's ſee, what thou canſt do; and do thy worſt.</hi> And I told him, <hi>The</hi> Devil <hi>was Raiſed high enough in him already; but the Power of God Chained him down:</hi> So he ſlu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now the Time of <hi>Worceſter-Fight</hi> coming on, <hi>Juſtice Bennet</hi> ſent the <hi>Conſtables to preſs me for a Souldier,</hi> ſeeing I would not volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily accept of a <hi>Command:</hi> And I told them, That I was brought off from outward <hi>Wars.</hi> They came down again to give me <hi>Preſs-Money;</hi> but I would take none.

               <hi>Sergeant Holes,</hi> and kept there a while;<note place="margin">1651. Darby-Priſon.</note> and then I was taken down again.

                        <p>CHRIST was ever hated; and the Righteous for his ſake. Mind, who they were, that did ever hate them: He that was born after the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> did perſecute him, that was born after the <hi>Spirit;</hi> and ſo it is now. And mind, who were the Chiefeſt againſt <hi>Chriſt;</hi> even the great <hi>Learned Men,</hi> the Heads of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Rulers and Teachers, that did profeſs the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> and looked for <hi>Christ.</hi> They looked for an outwardly-Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to hold up their outward Glory: But <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſpake againſt the Works of the World; and againſt the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and <hi>Scribes,</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and their hypocritical Profeſſion. He that is a Stranger to Chriſt, is an <hi>Hireling:</hi> but the Servants of Jeſus Chriſt are <hi>Freemen.</hi> The <hi>falſe Teachers</hi> always laid Burdens upon the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: and the <hi>true Servants</hi> of the Lord did ſpeak againſt them. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> did ſpeak againſt <hi>Hirelings,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>It was an horrible thing;</hi> and ſaid, <hi>What will ye do in the End?</hi> for the <hi>People</hi> and <hi>Prieſts</hi> were given to <hi>Covetouſneſs.

            <p>Great was the <hi>Exerciſe</hi> and <hi>Travel</hi> in Spirit, that I went under during my <hi>Impriſonment</hi> here, becauſe of the <hi>Wickedneſs</hi> that was in this Town: for though there were ſome <hi>Convinced</hi> there, yet for the generality they were an <hi>hardened People.</hi> And I ſaw the <hi>Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>God's Love</hi> paſs away from them; and I mourned over them. And it came upon me to give forth the following Lines, as a <hi>Lamentation</hi> for them:</p>
            <q>
               <p>O <hi>Darby!</hi> As the <hi>Waters</hi> run away, when the Flood-Gates are up; ſo doth the <hi>Viſitation</hi> of <hi>God's Love</hi> paſs away from thee, O <hi>Darby!</hi> Therefore look, where thou art, and how thou art grounded; and Conſider, before thou art utterly <hi>forſaken.</hi> The Lord moved me <hi>Twice,</hi> before I came to Cry againſt the <hi>Deceits</hi> and <hi>Vanities,</hi> that are in thee; and to warn all to look at the <hi>Lord,</hi> and not at <hi>Man.</hi> The <hi>Wo</hi> is againſt the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>Pride,</hi> and the <hi>Wo</hi> is againſt <hi>Drunkenneſs</hi> and <hi>vain Pleaſures,</hi> and againſt them that make a <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> in Words, and are high and lofty in Mind, and live in <hi>Oppreſſion</hi> and <hi>Envy.</hi> O <hi>Darby!</hi> thy <hi>Profeſſion</hi> and <hi>Preaching</hi> ſtinks before the Lord. Ye do profeſs a <hi>Sabbath</hi> in Words, and Meet together, dreſſing your ſelves in <hi>fine Apparel;</hi> and you uphold <hi>Pride.</hi> Thy <hi>Women</hi> go with <hi>ſtretched-forth Necks,</hi> and <hi>wanton Eyes,</hi> &amp;c. which the true <hi>Prophet</hi> of old Cryed againſt. Your <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> are odious, and an Abomination to the Lord: <hi>Pride</hi> is ſet up, and bowed down to; <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> abounds; and he that doth wickedly, is honoured: So <hi>Deceit</hi> doth bear with <hi>Deceit;</hi> and yet they profeſs Chriſt in Words. O the <hi>Deceit,</hi> that is within thee! It doth even break my Heart to ſee, how God is diſhonoured in thee, O <hi>Darby!</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>Now, after that I had ſeen the <hi>Viſitation</hi> of <hi>God's Love paſs away</hi> from this Place, I knew, that my <hi>Impriſonment</hi> here would not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue long: But I ſaw, that when the Lord ſhould bring me forth, it would be, as the letting of a <hi>Lion</hi> out of a <hi>Den</hi> amongſt the <hi>Wild Beaſts</hi> of the <hi>Forreſt.</hi> For all <hi>Profeſſions</hi> ſtood in a <hi>Beaſtly Spirit</hi> and <hi>Nature,</hi> pleading for <hi>Sin,</hi> and for the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Imperfection, as long as they lived:</hi> And they all kick'd, and yelled, and roar'd, and raged, and ran againſt the <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> which gave forth the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> which they profeſſed in words. And ſo it was; as will appear hereafter.</p>
            <pb n="53" facs="tcp:51448:61"/>
            <p>There was a great <hi>Judgment</hi> upon the <hi>Town;</hi> and the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> were uneaſie about me, and could not agree, what to do with me. One while they would have ſent me up to the <hi>Parliament:</hi> another while they would have <hi>Baniſhed</hi> me to <hi>Ireland.</hi> At firſt they called me a <hi>Deceiver,</hi> and a <hi>Seducer,</hi> and a <hi>Blaſphemer:</hi> afterwards, when God had brought his <hi>Plagues</hi> upon them, then they ſaid, I was an <hi>Honeſt, Vertuous Man.</hi> But their <hi>good Report,</hi> and <hi>bad Report,</hi> their well-ſpeaking or their ill-ſpeaking was nothing to me: for the one did not lift me up, nor the other caſt me down: Praiſed be the Lord! At length they were made to turn me out of <hi>Jail,</hi> about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>Winter</hi> in the Year 1651; after I had been a <hi>Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> in <hi>Darby</hi> almoſt <hi>a Year;</hi> whereof <hi>Six Months</hi> in the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Correction,</hi> and the reſt of the Time in the <hi>Common Jail</hi> and <hi>Dungeon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus being ſet at Liberty again, I went on (as before) in the <hi>Work</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> paſſing through the Country, firſt, into my own Country of <hi>Leiceſterſhire,</hi> and had <hi>Meetings</hi> as I went;<note place="margin">Leiceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</note> and the Lord's Spirit and Power accompanied me. Afterwards I went near to <hi>Burton upon Trent,</hi> where ſome were <hi>Convinced;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Burton <hi>upon</hi> Trent. Buſhel-Houſe.</note> and ſo to <hi>Buſhel-Houſe,</hi> where I had a <hi>Meeting.</hi> And I went up into the Country, where there were friendly People: But there was an outragious, wicked <hi>Profeſſor,</hi> who had an intent to have done me a Miſchief; but the <hi>Lord</hi> prevented him: Bleſſed be the <hi>Lord!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as I was walking along, with ſeveral <hi>Friends,</hi> I lifted up my Head, and ſaw <hi>Three Steeple-houſe-Spires;</hi> and they ſtruck at my <hi>Life.</hi> And I asked <hi>Friends,</hi> What Place that was? and they ſaid, <hi>Lichfield.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lichfield.</note> Immediately the <hi>Word</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> came to me, that I muſt <hi>go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> So being come to the Houſe, we were going to, I wiſh'd <hi>Friends,</hi> that were with me, to walk into the Houſe; ſaying nothing to them, whither I was to go. And as ſoon as they were gone, I ſtept away, and went by my Eye over Hedge and Ditch, till I came within a <hi>Mile</hi> of <hi>Lichfield;</hi> where, in a great Field, there were <hi>Shepherds</hi> keeping their <hi>Sheep.</hi> Then was I commanded by the Lord to <hi>pull off my Shoos.</hi> And I ſtood ſtill (for it was <hi>Winter:</hi>) And the <hi>Word</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> was like a <hi>Fire</hi> in me. So I <hi>put off my Shoos,</hi> and left them with the <hi>Shepherds;</hi> and the poor <hi>Shepherds trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,</hi> and were aſtoniſhed. Then I walked on about a <hi>Mile,</hi> till I came into the <hi>City;</hi> and as ſoon as I was got within the <hi>City,</hi> the <hi>Word</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> came to me again, ſaying; <hi>Cry, Wo unto the bloody City of Lichfield!</hi> So I went up and down the Streets, Crying with a loud Voice, <hi>WO TO THE BLOODY CITY OF LICHFIELD!</hi> And it being <hi>Market-Day,</hi> I went into the <hi>Market-Place,</hi> and to and fro in the ſeveral Parts of it, and made ſtands, Crying as before, <hi>WO TO THE BLOODY CITY OF LICHFIELD!</hi> And no one laid Hands on me. But as I went thus Crying through the Streets, there ſeemed to me to be a <hi>Channel</hi> of <hi>Blood</hi> running down the <hi>Streets,</hi> and the <hi>Market-Place</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared like a <hi>Pool</hi> of <hi>Blood.</hi> Now, when I had declared, what was upon me, and felt my ſelf Clear, I went out of the Town in Peace; and returning to the <hi>Shepherds,</hi> gave them ſome Money, and took my <hi>Shoos</hi> of them again. But the <hi>Fire</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> was ſo in my <hi>Feet,</hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:51448:62"/> and all over me,<note place="margin">1651. Lichfield.</note> that I did not matter to put on my <hi>Shoos</hi> any more; and was at a ſtand, whether I ſhould or no; till I felt freedom from the <hi>Lord</hi> ſo to do: and then, after I had waſhed my Feet, I put on my <hi>Shoes</hi> again. After this, a deep Conſideration came upon me, Why, or for what reaſon, I ſhould be ſent to <hi>Cry againſt that City,</hi> and call it <hi>THE BLOODY CITY?</hi> For though the <hi>Parliament</hi> had the <hi>Minſter</hi> one while, and the <hi>King</hi> another while, and much <hi>Blood</hi> had been ſhed in the <hi>Town,</hi> during the <hi>Wars</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them; yet that was no more, than had befallen many other Places. But afterwards I came to underſtand, that in the Emperor <hi>Diocletian</hi>'s Time a <hi>Thouſand Chriſtians</hi> were <hi>Martyred</hi> in <hi>Lichfield.</hi> So I was to go, without my <hi>Shoos,</hi> through the <hi>Channel</hi> of their <hi>Blood,</hi> and into the <hi>Pool</hi> of their <hi>Blood</hi> in the <hi>Market-Place,</hi> that I might <hi>Raiſe up the Memorial of the Blood of thoſe Martyrs,</hi> which had been ſhed above a <hi>Thouſand Years</hi> before, and lay <hi>Cold</hi> in their <hi>Streets.</hi> So the Senſe of this <hi>Blood</hi> was upon me, and I obeyed the <hi>Word</hi> of the <hi>Lord. Ancient Records</hi> teſtify, how many of the <hi>Chriſtian Britains</hi> ſuffered there. And much I could write of the Senſe I had of the <hi>Blood</hi> of the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> that hath been ſhed in this <hi>Nation</hi> for the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> both under the <hi>Ten Perſecutions,</hi> and ſince; but I leave it to the <hi>Lord,</hi> and to his <hi>Book,</hi> out of which all ſhall be Judged: For his <hi>Book</hi> is a moſt certain, true <hi>Record,</hi> and his <hi>Spirit</hi> a true <hi>Recorder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then paſſed I up and down through the <hi>Countries,</hi> having <hi>Meetings</hi> amongſt <hi>friendly People</hi> in many Places: But my <hi>Relations</hi> were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at me.<note place="margin">

So traveling through the Countries to ſeveral Places, preaching <hi>Repentance,</hi> and the Word of Life to the People, I came into the Parts about <hi>Wakefield,</hi> where <hi>James Naylor</hi> lived; and he and <hi>Thomas Goodyear</hi> came to me, and were both <hi>Convinced,</hi> and received the <hi>Truth. William Dewsbury</hi> alſo and his <hi>Wife,</hi> with many more, came to me, who were <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,</hi> and received the <hi>Truth.</hi> From thence I paſſed through the Country towards <hi>Captain Purſloe</hi>'s houſe by <hi>Selby,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Selby.</note> and viſited one <hi>John Leek,</hi> who had been to viſit me in <hi>Darby-Priſon,</hi> and was <hi>Convinced.</hi> I had an Horſe, but was fain to leave him, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, what to do with him: for I was moved to go to many <hi>great Houſes,</hi> to admoniſh and exhort the People <hi>to turn to the Lord,</hi> Thus paſſing on,<note place="margin">Beverly.</note> I was moved of the <hi>Lord</hi> to go to <hi>Beverly-Steeple-houſe,</hi> which was then a Place of high Profeſſion.

Come in,</hi> ſaid ſhe, as if ſhe had known me before: for the Lord's Power bowed their Hearts. So I refreſhed my ſelf, and went to Bed: And in the Morning, (my <hi>Cloaths</hi> being ſtill wet) I got rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and having paid, for what I had had in the <hi>Inn,</hi> I went up to the <hi>Steeple-houſe,</hi> where was a Man preaching.

So I paſſed away out of the Town: And in the Afternoon went to another <hi>Steeple-houſe,</hi> about <hi>Two Miles</hi> off: And when the <hi>Priest</hi> had done, I was moved to ſpeak to him, and to the People very largely, ſhewing them the <hi>Way</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> and the Ground of <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Reprobation.</hi> The <hi>Prieſt</hi> ſaid, he was but a <hi>Child,</hi> and could not <hi>diſpute</hi> with me: I told him, I did not come to <hi>diſpute;</hi> but to hold forth the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> unto them, that they might all know the <hi>One Seed,</hi> which the Promiſe of God was to, both in the <hi>Male</hi> and in the <hi>Female.</hi> Here the People were very loving, and would have had me come again on a <hi>Week-day,</hi> and preach among them: But I directed them to their <hi>Teacher, Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and ſo paſſed away; and the next Day went to <hi>Crantſick,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Crantſick.</note> to <hi>Captain Purſloe's,</hi> who accompanied me to <hi>Juſtice Hotham</hi>'s. This <hi>Juſtice Hotham</hi> was a pretty tender Man, one that had had ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences of <hi>God's Workings</hi> in his Heart. After I had had ſome Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with him of the things of God, he took me into his <hi>Cloſet;</hi> where ſitting together, he told me; he had known that <hi>Principle</hi> theſe <hi>Ten Years,</hi> and was glad, that the <hi>Lord</hi> did now publiſh it abroad to the People. After a while there came a <hi>Prieſt</hi> to viſit him, with whom alſo I had ſome Diſcourſe concerning <hi>Truth.</hi> But his Mouth was quickly ſtopt: for he was nothing but a <hi>Notioniſt,</hi> and not in <hi>Poſſeſſion,</hi> of what he talked of.</p>
            <p>While I was here, there came a <hi>Great Woman</hi> of <hi>Beverly,</hi> to ſpeak with <hi>Juſtice Hotham</hi> about ſome Buſineſs; and in Diſcourſe ſhe told him, <hi>That the laſt Sabbath-day</hi> (as ſhe called it) <hi>there was an Angel or Spirit came into the Church at</hi> Beverly, <hi>and ſpake the wonderful things of God, to the aſtoniſhment of all that were there: And when it had done, it paſſed away; and they did not know, whence it came, nor whither it went: But it aſtoniſhed all, both Priest, Profeſſors and Magiſtrates of the Town.</hi> This Relation <hi>Juſtice Hotham</hi> gave me af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards; and then I gave him an Account, how I had been that Day at <hi>Beverly-Steeple-houſe;</hi> and had declared <hi>Truth</hi> to the <hi>Prieſt</hi> and <hi>People</hi> there:</p>
            <p>There was in the County thereabouts ſome <hi>Noted Prieſts,</hi> and <hi>Doctors,</hi> that Juſtice <hi>Hotham</hi> had acquaintance with, and he would fain have them ſpeak with me; and offered to ſend for them, under pretence of ſome Buſineſs he had with them: but I wiſh'd him not to do ſo.</p>
            <p>Now when the <hi>Firſt Day</hi> of the <hi>Week</hi> was come, <hi>Juſtice Hotham</hi> walked out with me into the Fields; and then, <hi>Captain Purſloe</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up after us, <hi>Juſtice Hotham</hi> left us, and returned home; but <hi>Captain Purſloe</hi> went with me into the <hi>Steeple-houſe.</hi> And when the <hi>Prieſt</hi> had done, I ſpake to both <hi>Prieſt</hi> and <hi>People;</hi> and declared to them the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> and directed them, where they might find their <hi>Teacher,</hi> the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Some of the People were <hi>Convinced</hi> there that Day, and received the <hi>Truth,</hi> and ſtand faſt in it; and have a fine <hi>Meeting</hi> there-a-ways to this Day.</p>
            <pb n="56" facs="tcp:51448:63"/>
            <p>In the <hi>Afternoon</hi> I went to another <hi>Steeple-houſe,</hi> about <hi>Three Miles</hi> off, where preached a great <hi>High-Prieſt,</hi> called a <hi>Doctor</hi> (being one of them, whom <hi>Juſtice Hotham</hi> would have ſent for, to have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with me.) So I went into the <hi>Steeple-houſe,</hi> and ſtayed, till the <hi>Prieſt</hi> had done (Now the Words, which he took for his <hi>Text,</hi> were theſe; <hi>Ho, every One that Thirſteth, come ye to the Waters, and he that hath no Money, come ye, buy and eat, yea come, buy Wine and Milk without Money and without Price.</hi>) Then was I moved of the <hi>Lord God</hi> to ſay unto him; <hi>Come down, thou deceiver; Doſt thou bid People, Come</hi> freely, <hi>and take of the Water of Life</hi> freely, <hi>and yet thou takest</hi> Three hundred Pounds <hi>a</hi> Year <hi>of them, for preaching the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures to them! Mayeſt not thou bluſh for ſhame! Did the Prophet</hi> Iſaiah <hi>and</hi> Chriſt <hi>do ſo, who ſpake the Words, and gave them forth</hi> freely? <hi>Did not Chriſt ſay to his Miniſters, whom he ſent to preach, Freely ye have received, freely give?</hi> So the <hi>Priest,</hi> like a Man ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, haſtned away. And after he was gone, and had left his <hi>Flock,</hi> I had as much Time, as I could deſire, to ſpeak to the <hi>People.</hi> And I directed them from the <hi>Darkneſs</hi> to the <hi>Light,</hi> and to the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> that would Teach them, and bring them Salvation; and to the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in their Inward Parts, which would be a <hi>free Teacher</hi> unto them.</p>
            <p>Then, having Cleared my ſelf amongſt that People, I returned to <hi>Juſtice Hotham</hi>'s Houſe that Night; who when I came in, took me in his Arms, and ſaid: <hi>His Houſe was my Houſe,</hi> for he was exceeding glad at the <hi>work</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and that his <hi>Power</hi> was <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed.</hi> Then he told me, Why he went not with me to the <hi>Steeple-houſe</hi> in the Morning, and what Reaſonings he had in himſelf about it: for he thought, if he had gone with me to the <hi>Steeple-houſe,</hi> the <hi>Officers</hi> would have put me to him; and then he ſhould have been ſo put to it, that he ſhould not have known, what to have done: But he was glad, he ſaid, when <hi>Captain Purſloe</hi> came up to go with me. Yet neither of them was <hi>drest,</hi> nor had their <hi>Bands</hi> about their Necks. And it was a ſtrange thing then, to ſee a Man come into a <hi>Steeple-houſe</hi> without a <hi>Band:</hi> Yet <hi>Captain Purſloe</hi> went in with me without his <hi>Band;</hi> the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> had ſo affected him, that he minded it not.</p>
            <p>From hence I paſſed on through the Country, and came at Night to an <hi>Inn,</hi> where was a Company of <hi>rude People;</hi> and I bid the <hi>Woman</hi> of the <hi>Houſe,</hi> if ſhe had any <hi>Meat,</hi> to bring me ſome: But becauſe I ſaid <hi>Thee</hi> and <hi>Thou</hi> to her, ſhe looked ſtrangely on me. Then I asked her, if ſhe had any <hi>Milk?</hi> and ſhe ſaid, <hi>No.</hi> I was ſenſible, ſhe ſpake falſly: And ſeeing a <hi>Churn</hi> ſtanding in the Room, and being willing to try her further, I asked her; If ſhe had any <hi>Cream?</hi> ſhe denied, that ſhe had any. Now there ſtood a <hi>Churn</hi> in the Room, and a little <hi>Boy</hi> playing about it, put his Hands into it, and pulled it down; and threw all the <hi>Cream</hi> on the Floor before my Eyes. Thus was the <hi>Woman</hi> manifeſted to be a <hi>Liar.</hi> The <hi>Woman</hi> was amazed, and bleſt her ſelf, and took up the <hi>Child,</hi> and <hi>whipt</hi> it ſorely: But I reproved her for her <hi>Lying</hi> and <hi>Deceit.</hi> After the Lord had thus diſcovered her <hi>Deceit</hi> and <hi>Perverſneſs,</hi> I walked out of the <hi>Houſe,</hi> and went away, till I came to a <hi>Stack</hi> of <hi>Hay,</hi> and lay in
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:51448:63"/> the <hi>Hay-Stack</hi> that Night, in <hi>Rain</hi> and <hi>Snow;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1651. York.</note> it being but <hi>Three Days</hi> before the Time called <hi>Chriſtmas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>next day</hi> I came into <hi>York,</hi> where were ſeveral People, that were very tender. And upon the <hi>Firſt-Day</hi> of the <hi>Week</hi> following I was Commanded of the Lord, to go to the great <hi>Minſter,</hi> and ſpeak to <hi>Prieſt Bowles</hi> and his Hearers in their great <hi>Cathedral.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly I went: and when the <hi>Prieſt</hi> had done, I told them; <hi>I had ſomething from the Lord God to ſpeak to the</hi> Prieſt <hi>and</hi> People. <hi>Then ſay on quickly,</hi> ſaid <hi>a Profeſſor,</hi> that was among them; for it was <hi>Froſt</hi> and <hi>Snow,</hi> and very <hi>Cold Weather.</hi> Then I told them; <hi>This was the Word of the Lord God unto them, that they lived in</hi> Words; <hi>but God Almightly looked for</hi> Fruits <hi>amongſt them.</hi> As ſoon as the Words were out of my Mouth, they hurried me out, and threw me down the <hi>Steps:</hi> but I got up again without hurt, and went to my <hi>Lodging</hi> again; and ſeveral were <hi>Convinced</hi> there. For the very <hi>Groans,</hi> that aroſe from the <hi>Weight</hi> and <hi>Oppreſſion,</hi> that was upon the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God in me,</hi> would open People, and ſtrike them; and make them Confeſs, <hi>That the</hi> Groans, <hi>which brake forth through me, did reach them:</hi> For my <hi>Life</hi> was burthened with their <hi>Profeſſion</hi> without <hi>Poſſeſſion,</hi> and <hi>Words</hi> without <hi>Fruit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now after I had done my preſent Service in <hi>York,</hi> and that ſeveral were <hi>Convinced</hi> there, and received the <hi>Truth</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and were turned to his <hi>Teaching;</hi> I paſſed out of <hi>York,</hi> and looked towards <hi>Cleaveland.</hi> And I ſaw, there was a <hi>People,</hi> that had taſted of the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> and I ſaw then, there was a <hi>Seed</hi> in that <hi>Country,</hi> and that God had an <hi>humble People</hi> there. So I paſſed onwards that Night; and a <hi>Papiſt</hi> overtook me, and talked to me of his <hi>Religion,</hi> and of their <hi>Meetings:</hi> and I let him ſpeak all that was in his Mind. That Night I ſtayed at an <hi>Ale-houſe;</hi> and the next Morning I was moved of the Lord to ſpeak the <hi>Word</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> to this <hi>Papiſt.</hi> So I went to his Houſe, and declared againſt his <hi>Religion,</hi> and all their <hi>Superſtitious Ways;</hi> and told him, that <hi>God</hi> was come to <hi>teach his People himſelf.</hi> This put the <hi>Papiſt</hi> into ſuch a <hi>Rage,</hi> that he could not then endure to ſtay in his own Houſe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>next day</hi> I came to <hi>Burraby,</hi> where there was a <hi>Prieſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Burraby.</note> and ſeveral <hi>Friendly People</hi> Met together: Many of the People were <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,</hi> and have continued faithful ever ſince; and there is a great <hi>Meeting</hi> of <hi>Friends</hi> in that Town. The <hi>Prieſt</hi> alſo was forced to Confeſs to <hi>Truth,</hi> though he Came not into it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>day following</hi> I paſſed to <hi>Cleaveland,</hi> amongſt thoſe People,<note place="margin">Cleave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> that had taſted of the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God:</hi> They had formerly had great <hi>Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> but were then all ſhattered to pieces; and the <hi>Heads</hi> of them turned <hi>Ranters.</hi> I told them, <q>That after they had had ſuch <hi>Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> they did not <hi>Wait upon God</hi> to feel his <hi>Power,</hi> to gather their Minds Inward, that they might feel his <hi>Preſence</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them in their <hi>Meetings,</hi> to ſit down therein, and Wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him: for they had ſpoken themſelves <hi>dry;</hi> they had ſpent their <hi>Portions,</hi> and not living in that, which they ſpake of, they were now become <hi>DRY.</hi> They had ſome kind of <hi>Meetings</hi> ſtill: but they took <hi>Tobacco,</hi> and drank <hi>Ale</hi> in their <hi>Meetings;</hi> and were grown light and looſe.</q> But my Meſſage unto them from the <hi>Lord</hi>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:51448:64"/> was,<note place="margin">1651. Cleave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> 
               <q>That they ſhould all come together again, and <hi>Wait to feel the Lord's Power and Spirit in themſelves,</hi> to gather them to Chriſt, that they might be taught of him, who ſays, <hi>Learn of me.</hi> For when they had declared, that which the Lord had opened to them, then the People were to receive it; and both the <hi>Speakers</hi> and <hi>Hearers</hi> were to live in that themſelves. But when theſe had no more to declare, but went to ſeek <hi>Forms</hi> without <hi>Life;</hi> that made themſelves <hi>dry</hi> and <hi>barren,</hi> and the People alſo: and from thence came all their <hi>Loſs:</hi> for the Lord renews his <hi>Mercies</hi> and his <hi>Strength</hi> to them that <hi>Wait upon him.</hi>
               </q> The <hi>Heads</hi> of theſe People came to nothing: but moſt of the <hi>People</hi> came to be <hi>Convinced,</hi> and received God's everlaſting Truth, and continue a <hi>Meeting</hi> to this day; ſitting under the <hi>Teaching</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, their Saviour.</p>
            <p>Upon the <hi>Firſt day</hi> of the next <hi>Week</hi> the <hi>Word</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> came to me to go to the <hi>Steeple-houſe</hi> there; which I did. And when the <hi>Prieſt</hi> had done, I ſpake the <hi>Truth</hi> to him and the <hi>People,</hi> and directed them to their <hi>Teacher within,</hi> Chriſt Jeſus, their free Teacher, that had bought them. The <hi>Prieſt</hi> came to me; and I had a little Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with him: but he was ſoon ſtopt, and ſilent. Then, being Clear of the Place, I paſſed away, having had ſeveral <hi>Meetings</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe People.</p>
            <p>Though at this time the <hi>Snow</hi> was very deep; yet I kept traveling: And going through the Country, came to a <hi>Market-Town,</hi> where I met with many <hi>Profeſſors,</hi> with whom I had much Reaſoning; and I asked them many Queſtions, which they were not able to Anſwer; but ſaid, <hi>They had never had ſuch deep Queſtions put to them in all their Lives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Stath.</note>From them I went to another Place called <hi>Stath,</hi> where alſo I met with many <hi>Profeſſors,</hi> and ſome <hi>Ranters.</hi> I had great <hi>Meetings</hi> amongſt them, and a great <hi>Convincement</hi> there was, and many received the Truth: amongſt whom One was an <hi>Ancient Man</hi> of an <hi>hundred Years</hi> of <hi>Age;</hi> Another was a <hi>Chief Conſtable;</hi> and a <hi>third</hi> was a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> whoſe Name was <hi>Philip Scafe:</hi> Him the <hi>Lord,</hi> by his free Spirit, did afterwards make a free <hi>Miniſter</hi> of his free <hi>Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Prieſt</hi> of this Town was a lofty <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and did much Oppreſs the People for his <hi>Tithes:</hi> for if they went a <hi>Fiſhing</hi> many <hi>Leagues</hi> off, he would make them pay the <hi>Tithe-Money,</hi> of what they made of their <hi>Fiſh;</hi> though they catched them at a great diſtance, and carried them as far as <hi>Yarmouth</hi> to ſell. Now I was moved to go to the <hi>Steeple-houſe</hi> there, to declare the Truth, and lay open the <hi>Priest.</hi> And when I had ſpoken to the <hi>Priest,</hi> and laid his <hi>Oppreſſing</hi> of the People upon him, he fled away. The <hi>Chief</hi> of the <hi>Pariſh</hi> were very light and vain: So after I had ſpoken the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> to them, I turned away from them, becauſe they did not receive it; and left them. But the <hi>Word</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> which I had declared amongſt them, ſtuck with ſome of them; ſo that at Night ſome of the <hi>Heads</hi> of the <hi>Pariſh</hi> came to me: and moſt of them were <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced</hi> and ſatisfied, and confeſt to the <hi>Truth.</hi> Thus the <hi>Truth</hi> began to ſpread up and down that Country, and great <hi>Meetings</hi> we had;
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:51448:64"/> at which the <hi>Prieſt</hi> began to rage,<note place="margin">1651. Stath.</note> and the <hi>Ranters</hi> began to be ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: and they ſent me word, that they would have a <hi>Diſpute</hi> with me; both the <hi>Oppreſſing Prieſt,</hi> and the <hi>Leader</hi> of the <hi>Ranters.</hi> A day was ſet, and the <hi>Ranter</hi> came with his Company: and another <hi>Prieſt,</hi> a <hi>Scotch Man,</hi> came; but not the <hi>Oppreſſing Prieſt</hi> of <hi>Stath. Philip Scafe,</hi> who had been a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and was <hi>Convinced,</hi> was with me; and a great Number of People were met. When we were ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the <hi>Ranter,</hi> whoſe Name was <hi>T. Buſhel,</hi> told me; <hi>He had had a Viſion of me, that I was ſitting in a great Chair, and that he was to come and put off his Hat, and bow down to the Ground before me;</hi> and he did ſo: and many other flattering Words he ſpake. I told him, It was his own <hi>Figure:</hi> and ſaid unto him, <hi>Repent thou Beaſt.</hi> He ſaid, it was <hi>Jealouſy</hi> in me to ſay ſo. Then I asked him the <hi>Ground</hi> of <hi>Jealouſy,</hi> and how it came to be bred in Man? And the <hi>Nature</hi> of a <hi>Beaſt,</hi> what made it? And how that was bred in Man? For I ſaw him directly in that <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt;</hi> and therefore I would have known of him, how that <hi>Nature</hi> came to be bred in him? I told him, <hi>He ſhould give me an Account of things done in the Body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we came to diſcourſe of things done out of the Body.</hi> So I ſtopt up his Mouth, that he could ſay no more; and all his Fellow-<hi>Ranters</hi> were ſilenced: for he was the <hi>Head</hi> of them. Then I called for the <hi>Oppreſſing Prieſt;</hi> but he came not: Only the <hi>Scotch Prieſt</hi> came; but his Mouth was ſoon ſtopt with a very few Words; he being out of the <hi>Life</hi> of what he did profeſs. Then had I a good Opportunity with the <hi>People:</hi> and I laid open the <hi>Ranters,</hi> ranking them with the old <hi>Ranters</hi> in <hi>Sodom.</hi> And the <hi>Prieſts</hi> I manifeſted to be of the ſame ſtamp with their Fellow-<hi>Hirelings,</hi> the <hi>falſe Prophets</hi> of old, and the <hi>Prieſts</hi> that then bore rule over the People by their <hi>Means, ſeeking for their Gain from their Quarter, Divining for Money, and Teaching for filthy Lucre:</hi> and ſo I brought all the Prophets, and Chriſt, and the Apoſtles over the Heads of the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> ſhewing, how the Prophets, Chriſt and the Apoſtles had long ſince diſcovered them by their <hi>Marks</hi> and <hi>Fruits.</hi> Then I directed People to their <hi>Inward Teacher,</hi> Chriſt Jeſus their Saviour; and I preached up Chriſt in the Hearts of his People, when all theſe <hi>Mountains</hi> were laid low. The People were all quiet, and the Gainſayers Mouths were ſtopped: for though they broiled inwardly, yet the Power bound them down, that they could not break out.</p>
            <p>After the <hi>Meeting</hi> was over, this <hi>Scottiſh Prieſt</hi> deſired me to walk with him a <hi>top</hi> of the <hi>Cliffs.</hi> Whereupon I called a <hi>Brother-in-Law</hi> of his, who was in ſome meaſure <hi>Convinced,</hi> and deſired him to go with me, telling him; I was willing to have ſome Body by, to hear, what we ſaid; leſt the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> when I was gone, ſhould report any thing of me, which I did not ſay. So we went together; and as we walked, the <hi>Prieſt</hi> asked me many things concerning the <hi>Light,</hi> and concerning the <hi>Soul:</hi> To all which I anſwered him fully. When he had done queſtioning, we parted; and he went his way: and as he w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nt, meeting with the other <hi>Prieſt, Philip Scafe,</hi> that was <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,</hi> he <hi>brake his Cain</hi> againſt the Ground in Madneſs, and ſaid, <hi>If ever he met with me again, he would have my Life, or I ſhould have his;</hi> adding, <hi>that he would give his Head, if I was not knockt down
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:51448:65"/> within a Month.</hi> By this <hi>Friends</hi> ſuſpected, his intent was, in deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring me to walk with him alone, either to have <hi>Thruſt me down from off the Cliff,</hi> or to have done me ſome other <hi>Miſchief:</hi> And that when he ſaw himſelf fruſtrated in that, by my having one with me, that made him <hi>rage</hi> ſo. But I feared neither his <hi>Prophecies,</hi> nor his <hi>Threats:</hi> for I feared God Almighty. But ſome <hi>Friends,</hi> through their Affection to me, feared much, that this <hi>Prieſt</hi> would do me ſome <hi>Miſchief,</hi> or ſet on Others to do it. Yet after ſome Years, this very <hi>Scotch</hi> Prieſt, and his <hi>Wiſe</hi> alſo came to be <hi>Convinced</hi> of the <hi>Truth;</hi> and about <hi>Twelve Years</hi> after this I was at their Houſe.</p>
            <p>After this there came another <hi>Prieſt</hi> to a <hi>Meeting,</hi> where I was, (one that was in Repute above all the <hi>Prieſts</hi> in the Country) and as I was ſpeaking in the <hi>Meeting,</hi> That the <hi>Goſpel</hi> was the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and how it brought <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Immortality</hi> to <hi>Light</hi> in Men, and ſo was turning People from <hi>Darkneſs</hi> to the <hi>Light;</hi> this high-flown <hi>Prieſt</hi> ſaid, <hi>The Goſpel was Mortal.</hi> I told him, The true Miniſter ſaid, The <hi>Goſpel</hi> was the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> and would he make the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God Mortal?</hi> Upon that, the other Prieſt, <hi>Philip Scafe,</hi> that was <hi>Convinced,</hi> and had felt the <hi>Immortal Power</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, took him up, and reproved him; and ſo a great Diſpute aroſe between them: the <hi>Convinced Prieſt</hi> holding, that the <hi>Goſpel was Immortal;</hi> and the other <hi>Prieſt</hi> holding, that it was <hi>Mortal.</hi> But the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> was too hard for this <hi>Oppoſing Prieſt,</hi> and ſtopp'd his Mouth: And many People were <hi>Convinced,</hi> ſeeing the Darkneſs, that was in the <hi>Oppoſing Prieſt,</hi> and the Light that was in the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced Prieſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then another <hi>Prieſt</hi> ſent to have a <hi>Diſpute</hi> with me, and <hi>Friends</hi> went with me to the Houſe, where he was: But when he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, we were come, he <hi>ſlipt</hi> out of the <hi>Houſe,</hi> and hid himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Then I went to a <hi>Steeple-houſe</hi> hard by there, where the <hi>Prieſt</hi> and <hi>People</hi> were in a great rage: This <hi>Prieſt</hi> had threatned <hi>Friends,</hi> what he would do; but when I came there, he would not ſtand, but fled: for the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> came over him and them. Yea, the Lord's Everlaſting <hi>Power</hi> was over the <hi>World,</hi> and did reach to the Hearts of People, and made both <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Profeſſors tremble.</hi> It ſhook the earthly and airy Spirit, in which they held their <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Worſhip;</hi>
               <note place="margin">☞</note> ſo that it was a dreadful thing unto them, when it was told them, "<hi>The Man in Leathern Breeches is come.</hi> At the hearing thereof the <hi>Prieſts</hi> in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Places would get out of the way; they were ſo ſtruck with the <hi>dread</hi> of the <hi>Eternal Power</hi> of <hi>God:</hi> and <hi>Fear ſurprized</hi> the <hi>Hypocrites.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Whitby. Scarbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough. Wowls.

From thence I paſſed over the <hi>Wowls</hi> to <hi>Malton,</hi> where we had great <hi>Meetings;</hi> as we had alſo at the <hi>Towns</hi> thereabouts. At one of thoſe <hi>Towns</hi> there was a <hi>Prieſt</hi> ſent me a <hi>Challenge,</hi> to <hi>diſpute</hi> with me: But when I came, he would not come ſorth. So I had a good Opportunity with the People, and the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> ſeized up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them: And one, who had been a <hi>Wild, drunken Man,</hi> was reached therewith, ſo that he came to me as lowly, as a <hi>Lamb;</hi> though he and

            <p>On the <hi>Firſt-day</hi> following, there came one of the higheſt <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent-Profeſſors,</hi> a <hi>Woman,</hi> who had let in ſuch a <hi>Prejudice</hi> againſt me, that ſhe ſaid, before ſhe came, <hi>She could willingly have gone to ſee me hang'd.</hi> But when ſhe came, ſhe was <hi>Convinc'd;</hi> and remains a <hi>Friend.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then I turned to <hi>Malton</hi> again,<note place="margin">Malton.</note> and very great <hi>Meetings</hi> there were; to which ſeveral People more would have come, but durſt not for fear of their <hi>Relations:</hi> for it was thought a ſtrange thing then, <hi>to preach in Houſes,</hi> and not go to the <hi>Church</hi> (as they call'd it;) ſo that I was much deſired, to go and ſpeak in the <hi>Steeple-houſes.</hi> One of the <hi>Prieſts</hi> writ to me, and invited me to <hi>preach in his Steeple-houſe;</hi> calling me his <hi>Brother:</hi> Another <hi>Prieſt,</hi> a noted Man, kept a <hi>Lecture</hi> there. Now the <hi>Lord</hi> had ſhewed me, while I was in <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by-Priſon, That I ſhould ſpeak in</hi> Steeple-houſes, <hi>to gather People from thence;</hi> and a Concern ſometimes would come upon my Mind about the <hi>Pulpits,</hi> that the <hi>Prieſts</hi> lolled in.

Whereupon I ſtood up, and deſired all to be quiet: and ſtepping upon an <hi>High Seat,</hi> 
               <q>I declared unto them the <hi>Marks</hi> of the <hi>falſe Prophets;</hi> and ſhewed, <hi>That they were already come:</hi> and ſet the <hi>true Prophets,</hi> and Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles over them; and manifeſted, theſe to be out of the <hi>Steps</hi> of the <hi>true Prophets,</hi> and of Chriſt and his Apoſtles.

            <p>After ſome time, traveling in the Country, I came to <hi>Pickering,</hi> where in the <hi>Steeple-houſe</hi> the <hi>Juſtices</hi> held their <hi>Seſſions;</hi> Juſtice <hi>Robinſon</hi> being Chairman: and I had a <hi>Meeting</hi> in the <hi>School-houſe</hi> at the ſame time; and abundance of <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Profeſſors</hi> came to it, asking <hi>Queſtions;</hi> which were <hi>Anſwered</hi> to their Satisfaction. And it being <hi>Seſſions-time, four Chief-Conſtables,</hi> and many other Poople were <hi>Convinced</hi> that day. And word was carried to Juſtice <hi>Robinſon,</hi> that his <hi>Priest</hi> was <hi>Overthrown</hi> and <hi>Convinced;</hi> whom he had a <hi>Love</hi> to, more than to all the <hi>Prieſts</hi> beſides. After the <hi>Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> was done, we went to an <hi>Inn,</hi> and Juſtice <hi>Robinſon's Prieſt</hi> was very lowly and loving; and would have paid for my Dinner: but I would by no means ſuffer it. Then he offered, that I ſhould have his <hi>Steeple-houſe</hi> to preach in; But I denied it, and told him and the People, That <hi>I came to bring them off from ſuch things to Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>next</hi> Morning I went up, with the <hi>Four Chief-Conſtables,</hi> and ſome others, to viſit <hi>Juſtice Robinſon;</hi> who met me at his Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>door. I told him, <hi>I could not honour him with Man's Honour;</hi> and he ſaid, <hi>He did not look for it.</hi> So I went into his Chamber, and opened te him the <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>falſe Prophets,</hi> and of the <hi>true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets;</hi> and ſet the true Prophets, and Chriſt, and the Apoſtles over the other; and directed his Mind to <hi>Chriſt</hi> his <hi>Teacher;</hi> and opened to him the <hi>Parables,</hi> and how <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Reprobation</hi> ſtood; as that <hi>Reprobation</hi> ſtood in the <hi>firſt Birth,</hi> and <hi>Election</hi> ſtood in the <hi>ſecond Birth:</hi> I ſhewed alſo, what the <hi>Promiſe</hi> of <hi>God</hi> was to, and what the <hi>Judgment</hi> of <hi>God</hi> was againſt. He Confeſſed to it all; and was ſo opened with the <hi>Truth,</hi> that when another <hi>Juſtice,</hi> that was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, made ſome little <hi>Oppoſition;</hi> he <hi>Informed</hi> him. At our parting he ſaid, <hi>It was very well, that I did exerciſe that Gift, which God had given me:</hi> And he took the <hi>Chief-Conſtables</hi> aſide, and would have given them ſome <hi>Money,</hi> to have given me, ſaying; <hi>He would not have me be at any Charge in their Country:</hi> but they told him, That they themſelves could not get me to take any <hi>Money;</hi> and ſo accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Kindneſs, refuſed his <hi>Money.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From thence I paſſed up into the Country, and the <hi>Prieſt</hi> that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led me <hi>Brother</hi> (in whoſe <hi>School-houſe</hi> I had the <hi>Meeting</hi> at <hi>Pickering</hi>) went along with me. When we came into a <hi>Town</hi> to bait, the <hi>Bells</hi> rang: Whereupon I asked, What the <hi>Bells rang</hi> for? And they ſaid, <hi>for me to preach in the Steeple-houſe.</hi> After ſome Time I felt Drawings that way: And as I walked to the <hi>Steeple-houſe;</hi> I ſaw, the People were gathered together in the <hi>Steeple-houſe-yard.</hi> The <hi>Old Prieſt</hi> would have had me gone into the <hi>Steeple-houſe;</hi> but I ſaid, <hi>Nay, it was no matter:</hi> But it was ſomething ſtrange to the People, that I would not go into that, which they called the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> Then I ſtood up in the <hi>Steeple-houſe-yard,</hi> and declared to the People, <q>That I came not to hold up their <hi>Idol-Temples,</hi> nor their <hi>Prieſts,</hi> nor their <hi>Tithes,</hi> nor their <hi>Augmentations,</hi> nor their <hi>Prieſts-wages,</hi> nor their <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Heatheniſh Ceremonies</hi> and <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> (for I denyed all theſe) and told them, that that <hi>piece</hi> of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:51448:66"/> 
                  <hi>Ground</hi> was no more <hi>Holy,</hi> than another <hi>Piece</hi> of <hi>Ground.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1651. <hi>Yorkſhire.</hi>
                  </note> And I ſhewed them, that the Apoſtles going into the <hi>Jews Synagogues</hi> and <hi>Temples,</hi> which God had Commanded, was <hi>To bring People off</hi> from that <hi>Temple,</hi> and thoſe <hi>Synagogues,</hi> and from the <hi>Offerings</hi> and <hi>Tithes,</hi> and <hi>Covetous Prieſts</hi> of that Time. And that ſuch, as came to be <hi>Convinced</hi> of the Truth, and Converted to it, and believed in Jeſus Chriſt, whom the Apoſtles preached; they <hi>met together</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in <hi>Dwelling-Houſes.</hi> And that all who preach Chriſt, the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> ought to <hi>preach freely,</hi> as the Apoſtles did; and as he had Commanded. So I was ſent of the <hi>Lord God</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> to <hi>preach freely;</hi> and to bring People off from theſe outward <hi>Temples made with Hands,</hi> which God dwelleth not in; that they might know their <hi>Bodies</hi> to become the <hi>Temples</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> And to draw People off from all their <hi>Superſtitious Ceremonies,</hi> and <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Heatheniſh Cuſtoms, Traditions</hi> and <hi>Doctrines</hi> of <hi>Men;</hi> and from all the World's <hi>Hireling-Teachers,</hi> that take <hi>Tithes</hi> and great <hi>Wages, preaching for Hire, and divining for Money,</hi> whom God and Chriſt never ſent, as themſelves confeſs, when they ſay; They <hi>never heard God's Voice, nor Chriſt's Voice.</hi> Therefore I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted the People to come off from all theſe things, and directed them to the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in themſelves, and to the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Jeſus</hi> in their own Hearts; that they might come to know <hi>Chriſt,</hi> their <hi>Free Teacher,</hi> to bring them <hi>Salvation,</hi> and to open the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to them.</q> Thus the Lord gave me a good Opportunity amongſt them, to open things largely unto them; and all was qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, and <hi>many</hi> were <hi>Convinced:</hi> Bleſſed be the Lord.</p>
            <p>I paſſed on to another <hi>Town,</hi> where there was another great <hi>Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and the <hi>Old Prieſt</hi> before-mentioned went along with me; and there came <hi>Profeſſors</hi> of ſeveral ſorts to it. Now I ſate on an <hi>Hay-ſtack,</hi> and <hi>ſpake nothing for ſome Hours:</hi> for I was to famiſh them from <hi>Words.</hi> And the <hi>Profeſſors</hi> would ever and anon be ſpeaking to the <hi>Old Prieſt,</hi> and asking him, <hi>When I would begin? and when I would ſpeak?</hi> And he bad them <hi>Wait;</hi> and told them, <hi>That the People waited upon Christ a long while, before he ſpake.</hi> At laſt I was moved of the <hi>Lord</hi> to <hi>ſpeak;</hi> and they were ſtruck by the <hi>Lord's Power,</hi> and the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> reached to them, and there was a <hi>General Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincement</hi> amongſt them.</p>
            <p>From hence I paſſed on, the <hi>Old Prieſt</hi> being ſtill with me, and ſeveral others. And as we went along, ſome People called to the <hi>Old Prieſt,</hi> and ſaid; <hi>Mr.</hi> Boyes, <hi>We owe you ſome Money for Tithes, pray come and take it.</hi> But the <hi>Old Prieſt</hi> threw up his Hands, and ſaid; <hi>He had enough, he would have none of it; they might keep it:</hi> And, <hi>he praiſed the Lord, he had enough.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At length we came to this <hi>Old Priest</hi>'s <hi>Steeple-houſe</hi> in the <hi>Moors:</hi> And when we were come into it, the <hi>Old Prieſt</hi> went before me,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The</hi> Moors.</note> and held open the <hi>Pulpit-Door;</hi> but I forbad him, and told him, I ſhould not go into it. This <hi>Steeple-houſe</hi> was very much <hi>painted;</hi> and I told him and the People, That the <hi>painted Beaſt</hi> had a <hi>painted Houſe.</hi> Then I opened to them the <hi>Riſe</hi> of all thoſe <hi>Houſes,</hi> and their Superſtitious Ways; ſhewing them, that as the End of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles going into the <hi>Temple</hi> and <hi>Synagogues,</hi> which God had Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:51448:67"/> was not to hold them up;<note place="margin">1651. <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> in the Moors.</note> but to bring them to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Subſtance:</hi> So the End of my coming there, was not, to hold up theſe <hi>Temples, Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Tithes,</hi> which God had never Commanded; but to bring them off from all theſe things, to <hi>Christ</hi> the <hi>Subſtance.</hi> So I ſhewed them the <hi>True Worſhip,</hi> which Chriſt had ſet up: and diſtinguiſhed unto them <hi>Chriſt</hi> the <hi>True Way,</hi> from all the <hi>falſe Ways;</hi> opening the <hi>Parables</hi> to them, and turning them from the <hi>Darkneſs</hi> to the true <hi>Light,</hi> that by it they might ſee themſelves and their <hi>Sins,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> their <hi>Saviour;</hi> that believing in him, they might be ſaved from their <hi>Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this we went to one <hi>Birdet</hi>'s Houſe, where I had a great <hi>Meeting;</hi> and this <hi>Old Prieſt</hi> accompanied me ſtill, leaving his <hi>Steeple-houſe:</hi> For he had been looked upon as a famous <hi>Prieſt,</hi> above <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-prayer-Men,</hi> and <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and <hi>Independents</hi> too. Before he was <hi>Convinced,</hi> he would have gone ſometimes into their <hi>Steeple-houſes,</hi> and have preached: For he had been a zealous Man in his Way. And when they have Complained of him to <hi>Juſtice Hotham,</hi> he would bid them, <hi>Diſtrein his Horſe,</hi> for <hi>travelling on the Lord's Day</hi> (as he call'd it:) But <hi>Hotham</hi> did that only to put them off; for he knew, the <hi>Prieſt</hi> uſed no <hi>Horſe,</hi> but travelled on <hi>Foot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Crantſick.</note>Now came I up through the Country again towards <hi>Crantſick,</hi> to <hi>Captain Purſlo</hi>'s and <hi>Juſtice Hotham</hi>'s, who received me kindly; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glad, that the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Power</hi> had ſo appeared; and that <hi>Truth</hi> was ſpread, and ſo many had received it; and that <hi>Juſtice Robinſon</hi> was ſo Civil. And <hi>Juſtice Hotham</hi> ſaid; If God had not raiſed up this <hi>Principle</hi> of <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> which I preached, the Nation had been over-run with <hi>Ranteriſm;</hi> and all the <hi>Juſtices</hi> in the Nation could not have ſtopped it with all their <hi>Laws:</hi> Becauſe (ſaid he) they would have <hi>ſaid,</hi> as we <hi>ſaid,</hi> and <hi>done</hi> as we <hi>Commanded;</hi> and yet have kept their own <hi>Principle</hi> ſtill. But this <hi>Principle</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> (ſaid he) overthrows their <hi>Principle</hi> and the <hi>Root</hi> and <hi>Ground</hi> thereof; and therefore (he ſaid) he was glad, the <hi>Lord</hi> had raiſed up this <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Truth.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Holder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note>From thence I travelled up into <hi>Holderneſs,</hi> and came to a <hi>Juſtice's Houſe,</hi> whoſe Name was <hi>Pearſon;</hi> where there was a very tender <hi>Woman,</hi> that believed in the <hi>Truth,</hi> and was ſo affected therewith, that ſhe ſaid; <hi>She could have left all, and have followed me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Oram.</note>Thence I went to <hi>Oram,</hi> to one <hi>George Hartiſe</hi>'s; where many of that Town were <hi>Convinced.</hi> On the <hi>firſt-Day</hi> I was moved to go into the <hi>Steeple-houſe,</hi> where the <hi>Priest</hi> had got <hi>another Priest</hi> to help him: And a many <hi>Profeſſors</hi> and Contenders were got together. But the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> was over all, and the <hi>Prieſts</hi> fled away, and a great deal of good Service I had for the Lord amongſt the People.

            <p>The <hi>next</hi> day <hi>Friends</hi> and friendly People having left me, I tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veled alone, declaring the <hi>Day</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> amongſt People in the <hi>Towns,</hi>

And when I had cleared my ſelf, I went to an <hi>Inn,</hi> and deſired them to let me have a <hi>Lodging;</hi> but they would not. Then I deſired them to let me have a little <hi>Meat,</hi> or <hi>Milk,</hi> and I would pay them for it; but they would not. So I walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the Town, and a Company of <hi>Fellows</hi> follow'd me, and asked me; <hi>What News?</hi> And I bid them <hi>Repent, and fear the Lord.</hi> After I was gone a pretty way out of the Town, I came to another <hi>Houſe,</hi> and I deſired the People of that Houſe to let me have a little <hi>Meat,</hi> and <hi>Drink,</hi> and <hi>Lodging</hi> for my Money; but they would not neither, but denied me.

Then they guarded me about <hi>Nine Miles</hi> to a <hi>Juſtice;</hi> and when I was come near his Houſe, there came a Man riding after us, and asked me, <hi>Whether I was the Man, that was apprehended?</hi> And I asked him, Wherefore he asked? And he ſaid, <hi>For no hurt;</hi> and I told him, I was: So he rode away to the <hi>Juſtice</hi> before us. The Men, that guarded me, ſaid; <hi>It was well, if the</hi> Juſtice <hi>was not</hi> drunk, <hi>before we got to him: for he uſed to be</hi> drunk <hi>early.</hi> Now when I was brought in before him, becauſe I did not <hi>put off</hi> my <hi>Hat,</hi> and ſaid <hi>Thou</hi> to him, he asked the Man, that rode thither before me, <hi>Whether I was not mazed, or fond?</hi> But the Man told him, <hi>No; it was my Principle.</hi> Then I warned him to <hi>Repent,</hi> and come to the <hi>Light,</hi> which Chriſt had enlightned him withal; that by it he might ſee all his evil <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Actions,</hi> that he had ſpoken and acted (his ungodly <hi>Ways</hi> he had walked in, and his ungodly <hi>Words</hi> he had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken) and to return to Chriſt Jeſus, whilſt he had time; and that whilſt he had Time, he ſhould prize it. <hi>Ay, Ay,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>the</hi> Light, <hi>that is ſpoken of in the</hi> third <hi>of</hi> John: I deſired him, that he would mind it, and obey it. And as I admoniſhed him, I laid my Hand upon him; and he was brought down by the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Lord:</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:51448:68"/> And all the <hi>Watch-men</hi> ſtood <hi>amazed.</hi> Then he took me into a little <hi>Parlour</hi> with the other Man, and deſired to ſee, what I had in my Pockets, of <hi>Letters,</hi> or <hi>Intelligence;</hi> and I plucked out my <hi>Linnen,</hi> and ſhewed him, that I had no <hi>Letters:</hi> So he ſaid, He is not a <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant</hi> by his Linnen: and then he ſet me at Liberty. Then I went back to <hi>Patrington</hi> again, with that Man, that had ridden before me to the <hi>Juſtice;</hi> for he lived at <hi>Patrington.</hi> When I came there, he would have had me have had a <hi>Meeting</hi> at the <hi>Croſs:</hi> But I ſaid, It was no matter, his <hi>Houſe</hi> would ſerve. Then he deſired me to <hi>go to Bed,</hi> or <hi>lie down upon a Bed:</hi> Which he did, that they might ſay, they had ſeen me in a <hi>Bed,</hi> or upon a <hi>Bed;</hi> for they had got up a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that I would not lie on any <hi>Bed,</hi> becauſe at that time I lay many times without Doors. Now when the <hi>Firſt-day</hi> of the <hi>Week</hi> was come, I went to the <hi>Steeple-houſe,</hi> and declared the Truth to the <hi>Prieſt</hi> and <hi>People:</hi> and the People did not moleſt me; for the Power of God was come over them. Then preſently after I had a great <hi>Meeting</hi> at that Man's Houſe, where I lay: And many that day were <hi>Convinced</hi> there of the <hi>Lord's</hi> Everlaſting <hi>Truth;</hi> who ſtand faithful Witneſſes for it to this day. And they were exceeding ſorry and grieved, that they did not Receive me, nor give me Lodging, when I was there before.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">York-ſhire.</note>From hence I Traveled through the Country, even to the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt part thereof; Warning People, both in Towns and in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-Villages, to <hi>Repent;</hi> and directing them to <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> their <hi>Teacher.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the <hi>Firſt-day</hi> of the <hi>Week</hi> I came to one <hi>Colonel Overton</hi>'s Houſe, and had a great <hi>Meeting</hi> of the <hi>Prime</hi> of the <hi>People</hi> of that Country; where many things were opened out of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> which they had never heard before in all their Lives: and many were <hi>Convinced,</hi> and received the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> and were ſettled in the <hi>Truth</hi> of <hi>God.</hi>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Patring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</note>Then I returned to <hi>Patrington</hi> again, and viſited thoſe <hi>Friends,</hi> that were <hi>Convinced</hi> there; by whom I underſtood, that a <hi>Taylor,</hi> and ſome wild Blades in that Town had occaſioned my being carried before the <hi>Juſtice.</hi> The <hi>Taylor</hi> came to ask me forgiveneſs, fearing, I would Complain of him: The <hi>Conſtables</hi> alſo were afraid, leſt I ſhould trouble them: But I forgave them all, and warned them to turn to the Lord, and to amend their Lives. Now that which made them the more afraid, was this: When I was in the <hi>Steeple-houſe</hi> at <hi>Oram</hi> not long before, there came a <hi>Profeſſor,</hi> and gave me a <hi>Puſh</hi> on the <hi>Breaſt</hi> in the <hi>Steeple-houſe,</hi> and bid me, <hi>Get</hi> me <hi>out of the Church:</hi> Alas, <hi>poor Man,</hi> ſaid I, doſt thou call the <hi>Steeple-houſe</hi> the <hi>Church?</hi> The <hi>Church</hi> is the <hi>People,</hi> whom God hath purchaſed with his <hi>Blood,</hi> and not the <hi>Houſe.</hi> It happened, that <hi>Juſtice Hotham</hi> came to hear of this Man's <hi>Abuſe</hi> done to me; and ſent his <hi>Warrant</hi> for him, and bound him over to the <hi>Seſſions:</hi> So affected was he with the <hi>Truth;</hi> and ſo Zealous to keep the <hi>Peace.</hi> And indeed, this <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice Hotham</hi> had asked me before, whether any People had meddled with me, or abuſed me? But I was not to tell him any thing of that kind; but was to forgive all.</p>
            <pb n="67" facs="tcp:51448:68"/>
            <p>From <hi>Patrington</hi> I went to ſeveral <hi>Great Men's Houſes,</hi> warning them to <hi>Repent:</hi> Some Received me lovingly, and ſome ſlighted me. Thus I paſſed on through the Country: And at Night came to another <hi>Town,</hi> where I deſired <hi>Lodging</hi> and <hi>Meat,</hi> and I would pay for it: But they would not <hi>Lodge</hi> me, except I would go to the <hi>Conſtable,</hi> which was the Cuſtom (they ſaid) of all <hi>Lodgers</hi> at <hi>Inns,</hi> if <hi>Strangers.</hi> I told them, I ſhould not go: for that Cuſtom was for <hi>ſuſpicious Perſons;</hi> but I was an Innocent Man. So, after I had warned them to <hi>Repent,</hi> and declared unto them the <hi>Day</hi> of their <hi>Viſitation,</hi> and directed them to the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> that they might come to know Salvation, I paſſed away; and the People were ſomething tendered, and troubled afterwards. But when it grew dark, I ſpied an <hi>Hay-Stack,</hi> and went, and ſate under it all Night, till Morning.</p>
            <p>The <hi>next</hi> Day I paſſed into <hi>Hull,</hi>

            <p>Afterward, paſſing through the Country, I came to <hi>Balby,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Balby.</note> and viſited <hi>Friends</hi> up and down in thoſe Parts; And then paſſed into the Edge of <hi>Nottinghamſhire,</hi> viſiting <hi>Friends</hi> there:<note place="margin">Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamſhire.

Then I went further into the Country, and had ſeveral <hi>Meetings</hi> there-aways.

Then was I moved of the <hi>Lord God</hi> to ſtand up upon the Table, in the Eternal Power of God, and tell the People, <hi>That</hi> Chriſt <hi>was in them, except they were Reprobates; and that it was</hi> Chriſt, <hi>the Eternal Power of God, that ſpake in me at that time unto them: NOT, that I was CHRIST.</hi> And the People were generally ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, except himſelf, and a <hi>Profeſſor,</hi> and his own <hi>falſe Witneſſes.</hi> And I called the Accuſer, <hi>Judas;</hi> and was moved to tell him, That he was <hi>Judas,</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> his <hi>End</hi> ſhould be his; and that that was the <hi>Word</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and of <hi>Chriſt</hi> through me to him.

            <p>The <hi>ſame</hi> Day <hi>Richard Farnſworth</hi> went to another great <hi>Steeple-houſe,</hi> belonging to a great <hi>High-prieſt,</hi> and declared the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> unto the People; and a great Service he had amongſt them: For the <hi>Lord's Dread</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> was mightily over all.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Prieſt</hi> of that Church, which <hi>James Naylor</hi> had been a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of, whoſe Name mas <hi>Marſhal,</hi> raiſed many Wicked <hi>Slanders</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, as, <hi>That I carried Bottles about with me, and made People drink of my Bottles, and that made them follow me.</hi> And, <hi>That I rid upon a great Black Horſe, and was ſeen in one Country upon my Black Horſe in one Hour, and in the ſame Hour in another Country Threeſcore Miles off;</hi> and <hi>That I ſhould give a Fellow Money to follow me, when I was on my Black Horſe:</hi> With theſe <hi>Helliſh Lies</hi> he fed his People, to make them think <hi>Evil</hi> of the <hi>Truth,</hi> which I had declared amongſt them. But by theſe <hi>Lies</hi> of his, he preached many of his <hi>Hearers</hi> away from him: For I was then on <hi>Foot,</hi> and travelled on <hi>foot,</hi> and had no <hi>Horſe</hi> at that Time; and that the People gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:51448:70"/> knew. But the Lord ſoon after met with this Envious <hi>Prieſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1652. High-town.</note> and <hi>Cut him off</hi> in his <hi>Wickedneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this I came to a Town called <hi>High-Town,</hi> where dwelt a <hi>Woman,</hi> who had been <hi>Convinced</hi> a little before; and we went to her Houſe, and had a <hi>Meeting:</hi> and the <hi>Towns-people</hi> gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and we declared the <hi>Truth</hi> to them, and had ſome <hi>Service</hi> for the <hi>Lord</hi> amongſt them; and they paſſed away again peaceably. But there was a <hi>Widow-woman</hi> in the Town, whoſe Name was <hi>Green,</hi> who being filled with <hi>Envy,</hi> went to one, that was called a <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> in the <hi>Town</hi> (who was reported to have killed <hi>Two Men</hi> and <hi>One Woman</hi>) and Informed him againſt us; though he was no <hi>Officer.</hi> The <hi>next</hi> Morning we drew up ſome <hi>Queries,</hi> to be ſent to the <hi>Prieſt:</hi> And when we had done, and were juſt going away, ſome of the <hi>Friendly People</hi> of the <hi>Town</hi> came running up to the Houſe, where we were, and told us; <hi>That this</hi> Murdering Man <hi>had ſharpened a</hi> Pike <hi>to ſtab us, and was coming up with his Sword by his Side.</hi> We were juſt paſſing away, and ſo miſſed him. But we were no ſooner gone, but he came to the <hi>Houſe,</hi> where we had been; and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple generally Concluded, <hi>If we had not been gone, he would have murdered ſome of us.</hi> That Night we lay in a <hi>Wood,</hi> and were very Wet; for it Rained exceedingly. In the <hi>Morning</hi> I was moved to come back to that <hi>Town</hi> again; and then they gave us a full <hi>Relation</hi> of this <hi>wicked Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence we paſſed to <hi>Bradford,</hi> and came to an Houſe,<note place="margin">Bradford.</note> where we met with <hi>Richard Farnſworth</hi> again; from whom we had parted a little before. When we came in, they ſet <hi>Meat</hi> before us; but as I was going to <hi>Eat,</hi> the <hi>Word</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> came to me, ſaying; <hi>Eat not the Bread of ſuch, as have an Evil Eye.</hi> Immediately I aroſe from the <hi>Table,</hi> and <hi>ate</hi> nothing: The <hi>Woman</hi> of the <hi>Houſe</hi> was a <hi>Baptiſt.</hi> So after I had exhorted the Family, <hi>To turn to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and hearken to his Teachings in their own Hearts,</hi> We departed thence.</p>
            <p>And as we travelled through the Country, preaching <hi>Repentance</hi> to the People, we came into a <hi>Market-town</hi> on the <hi>Market-day;</hi> and there was a <hi>Lecture</hi> there that Day: And I went into the <hi>Steeple-houſe,</hi> where were many <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and <hi>Profeſſors,</hi> and <hi>People.</hi> The <hi>Prieſt,</hi> that preached, took for his <hi>Text</hi> thoſe Words of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> Chap. 5. ver 31. <hi>My People love to have it ſo:</hi> Leaving out the foregoing Words, viz. <hi>The Prophets propheſy falſly, and the Prieſts bear Rule by their Means.</hi> So I ſhewed the People his <hi>Deceit;</hi> and directed them to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the true <hi>Teacher within;</hi> declaring unto them, that God was come to <hi>Teach his People himſelf,</hi> and to bring them off from all the <hi>World's Teachers</hi> and <hi>Hirelings;</hi> that they might come to receive <hi>freely</hi> from him. Then warning them of the <hi>Day</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> that was coming upon all Fleſh, I paſſed from thence without much Oppoſition.</p>
            <p>At Night we came to a <hi>Country-houſe;</hi> and there was no <hi>Ale-houſe</hi> near. They deſired us to ſtay there all Night; which we did, and had good <hi>Service</hi> for the <hi>Lord,</hi> declaring his <hi>Truth</hi> amongſt them.</p>

               </note>The <hi>next</hi> Day we paſſed on: For the <hi>Lord</hi> had ſaid unto me; <hi>If but one Man or Woman were Raiſed up by his Power, to ſtand and live in the ſame Spirit, that the Prophets and Apoſtles were in, who gave forth the Scriptures,</hi>

               <note place="margin">Pendle-hill.</note>As we travelled on, we came near a very great and high <hi>Hill,</hi> called <hi>Pendle-hill,</hi> and I was moved of the Lord, <hi>to go up to the Top of it;</hi> which I did with much ado, it was ſo very <hi>Steep</hi> and <hi>High.</hi> When I was come to the <hi>Top</hi> of this <hi>Hill,</hi> I ſaw the <hi>Sea</hi> bordering upon <hi>Lancaſhire:</hi> And from the <hi>Top</hi> of this <hi>Hill</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> let me <hi>ſee,</hi> in what Places he had a <hi>Great People</hi> to be gathered.

            <p>At Night we came to an <hi>Inn,</hi> and declared Truth to the <hi>Man</hi> of the <hi>Houſe,</hi> and writ a <hi>Paper</hi> to the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Profeſſors,</hi> declaring <q>the <hi>Day</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and that <hi>Chriſt was come to teach People himſelf,</hi> by his Power and Spirit in their <hi>Hearts,</hi> and to bring People off from all the World's <hi>Ways</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> to his own free <hi>Teaching,</hi> who had bought them, and was the <hi>Saviour</hi> of all them, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in him.</q> The <hi>Man</hi> of the <hi>Houſe</hi> ſpread the <hi>Paper</hi> abroad, and was himſelf mightily affected with the <hi>Truth.</hi> Here the <hi>Lord</hi> opened unto me, and let me <hi>ſee</hi> a <hi>Great People in white Raiment by a River<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, coming to the Lord:</hi> And the Place that I ſaw them in, was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Wentzerdale</hi> and <hi>Sedbergh.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>next</hi> Day we travelled on, and at Night got a little <hi>Fern</hi> or <hi>Brakins</hi> to lay under us, and lay upon a <hi>Common.</hi> Next Morning we reached to a <hi>Town,</hi> and there <hi>Richard Farnſworth</hi> parted from me; and then I travelled alone again.<note place="margin">Wentzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale.</note> So I came up <hi>Wentzerdale,</hi> and at the <hi>Market-Town</hi> in that <hi>Dale</hi> there was a <hi>Lecture</hi> on the <hi>Market-day;</hi> and I went into the <hi>Steeple-houſe.</hi> And after the <hi>Prieſt</hi> had done, <q>I Proclaimed the <hi>Day</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> to the <hi>Prieſt</hi> and <hi>People;</hi> Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to turn from the <hi>Darkneſs</hi> to the <hi>Light,</hi> and from the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Satan</hi> unto <hi>God,</hi> that they might come to know <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> aright, and to receive his <hi>Teaching,</hi> who <hi>teacheth freely.</hi>
               </q> And largely and freely did I declare the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> unto them, and had not much <hi>Perſecution</hi> there. Afterwards I paſſed up the <hi>Dales,</hi> Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing People to <hi>fear God;</hi> and preaching the Everlaſting <hi>Goſpel</hi> to them. And in my way I came to a <hi>Great Houſe,</hi> where there was a <hi>School-maſter;</hi> and they got me into the Houſe.

               <note place="margin">1652.

Then having exhorted them to <hi>Repentance,</hi> and directed them to the <hi>Light</hi> of Chriſt Jeſus, that through it they might come unto him, and be <hi>ſaved;</hi> I paſſed from them, and came in the Night to a little <hi>Ale-houſe</hi> on a <hi>Common,</hi> where there was a Company of <hi>Rude Fellows drinking.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I would not drink with them, they got up their <hi>Clubs,</hi> and were <hi>ſtriking</hi> at me: but I reproved them, and brought them to be ſomewhat <hi>Cooler;</hi> and then I walked out of the <hi>Houſe</hi> upon the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> in the Night. After ſome time one of theſe <hi>drunken Fellows</hi> came out, and would have come cloſe up to me, pretending to <hi>whiſper</hi> to me: but I perceived, he had a <hi>Knife;</hi> wherefore I kept off from him, and bid him <hi>Repent, and fear God.</hi> So the Lord by his Power preſerved me from this <hi>Wicked Man;</hi> and he went into the Houſe again. The <hi>next</hi> Morning I went on through other <hi>Dales,</hi>

            <p>As thus I traveled on through the <hi>Dales,</hi> I came to another Man's Houſe, whoſe Name was <hi>Tennant:</hi> And I was moved to ſpeak to the <hi>Family,</hi> and declare God's Everlaſting <hi>Truth</hi> to them. And as I was turning away from them, I was moved to <hi>turn again,</hi> and ſpeak to the <hi>Man</hi> himſelf: And he was <hi>Convinced,</hi> and his <hi>Family,</hi> and lived and died in the <hi>Truth.</hi> Thence I came to <hi>Major Bousfield</hi>'s, who received me, as did alſo ſeveral others; and ſome that were then <hi>Convinced,</hi> have ſtood faithful ever ſince.<note place="margin">Gryſedale.</note> I went alſo thro' <hi>Gryſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale,</hi> and ſeveral other of thoſe <hi>Dales;</hi> in which ſome were <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced.</hi> And I went into <hi>Dent,</hi> where many were <hi>Convinced</hi> alſo.<note place="margin">Dent.</note> But from <hi>Major Bousfield</hi>'s I came to <hi>Richard Robinſon</hi>'s, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Everlaſting <hi>Truth</hi> to him.</p>

               <q>There I declared the Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting <hi>Truth</hi> of the Lord, and the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> for ſeveral Hours; ſhewing, that the Lord was come to <hi>Teach</hi> his People himſelf, and to bring them off from all the <hi>World's Ways</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> to Chriſt the true <hi>Teacher,</hi> and the true <hi>Way</hi> to God.

            <p>Then I paſſed on to <hi>John Audland</hi>'s and <hi>Gervaſe Benſon</hi>'s, and had great Meetings amongſt thoſe <hi>People,</hi> that had been <hi>Convinced</hi> before: And to <hi>John Blakelin</hi>'s and <hi>Richard Robinſon</hi>'s, and had mighty <hi>Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> there; and ſo up towards <hi>Griſedale.</hi>

            <p>Soon after <hi>Judge Fell</hi> being come home, <hi>Margaret Fell</hi> his <hi>Wife</hi> ſent to me, deſiring me to return thither: And I feeling Freedom from the Lord ſo to do,<note place="margin">Swarth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</note> went back through the Country to <hi>Swarth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</hi> Where when I came, I found, the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Profeſſors,</hi> and that envious <hi>Juſtice Sawrey</hi> had much Incenſed <hi>Judge Fell</hi> and <hi>Captain Sands</hi> againſt the <hi>Truth,</hi> by their Lies: But when I came to ſpeak with him, I anſwered all his <hi>Objections;</hi> and ſo throughly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied him by the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> that he was <hi>Convinced</hi> in his <hi>Judgment.</hi> Then he asked me, <hi>If I was that</hi> George Fox, <hi>whom</hi> Juſtice Robinſon <hi>ſpake ſo much in Commendation of amongſt many of the</hi> Parliament Men?

There came to <hi>Judge Fell</hi>'s that <hi>Captain Sands</hi> before-mentioned, endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to Incenſe the <hi>Judge</hi> againſt me; for he was an <hi>evil-minded Man,</hi> and full of <hi>Envy</hi> againſt me: And yet he could ſpeak high things, and uſe the <hi>Scripture-words,</hi> and ſay, <hi>Behold, I make all things new.</hi> But I told him, <q>Then he muſt have a <hi>New God;</hi> for his <hi>God</hi> was his <hi>Belly.</hi>
               </q> Beſides him, thither came alſo that envious <hi>Juſtice John Sawrey:</hi> And I told him, <hi>His Heart was rotten, and he was full of Hypocriſy to the Brim.</hi> Several other People alſo came, whoſe <hi>States</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> gave me a <hi>diſcerning</hi> of; and I ſpake unto their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</hi> And while I was in thoſe Parts, <hi>Richard Farnſworth</hi> and <hi>James Naylor</hi> came thither to ſee me, and the <hi>Family;</hi> and <hi>Judge Fell</hi> being ſatisfied, that it was the <hi>Way</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> notwithſtanding all their <hi>Oppoſition</hi> let the <hi>Meeting</hi> be kept at his <hi>Houſe:</hi> And a great <hi>Meeting</hi> was

            <p>Now after I had ſtay'd a while,<note place="margin">Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barrow.</note> and the <hi>Meeting</hi> there was well ſettled, I departed from thence, and went to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderbarrow,</hi> where I had a great <hi>Meeting.</hi> From thence I went to <hi>Kellet,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Kellet.</note> and had a great <hi>Meeting</hi> at <hi>Robert Withers,</hi> to which ſeveral came from <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and ſome from <hi>York;</hi> and many were <hi>Convinced</hi> there. Then on the <hi>Market-day</hi> I went to <hi>Lancaſter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lancaſter</note> and ſpake through the <hi>Market</hi> in the dreadful <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> declaring the <hi>Day</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and crying out againſt all their <hi>deceitful Merchandize:</hi> And I preached <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> unto them, which they ſhould all follow after, and walk and live in; directing them, how and where they might find and receive the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> to guide them there-into. After I had cleared my ſelf in the <hi>Market,</hi> I went to my <hi>Lodging,</hi> whither ſeveral People came to me; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were <hi>Convinced</hi> there, who have ſtood faithful to the <hi>Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the <hi>Firſt-Day</hi> following, in the <hi>Forenoon,</hi> I had a great <hi>Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> in the <hi>Street</hi> at <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> amongſt the <hi>Souldiers</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> unto whom I declared the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> and the Everlaſting <hi>Truth:</hi> And I opened unto them, That all the <hi>Traditions</hi> they had lived in, and all their <hi>Worſhips</hi> and <hi>Religions,</hi> and the <hi>Profeſſion</hi> they made of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> was good for nothing, while they lived out of the <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> which they were in, who gave forth the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> And I directed them to the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the heavenly Man, and to the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in their own Hearts, that they might come to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with <hi>God</hi> and with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and receive him for their <hi>Teacher,</hi> and know his <hi>Kingdom</hi> ſet up in them.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Afternoon</hi> I went up to the <hi>Steeple-houſe</hi> at <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the <hi>Truth</hi> both to the <hi>Prieſt</hi> and <hi>People;</hi> laying open before them the <hi>Deceits</hi> they lived in; and directing them to the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which they wanted.

            <p>On another <hi>Firſt-Day</hi> I went to another <hi>Steeple-houſe</hi> by the <hi>Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,</hi> where one <hi>Whitehead</hi> was <hi>Prieſt;</hi> to whom, and to the People I declared the <hi>Truth</hi> in the <hi>dreadful Power</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> And there came to me a <hi>Doctor,</hi> who was ſo full of <hi>Envy,</hi> that he ſaid, <hi>He could find in his Heart, to run me through with his Rapier, though he was hanged for it the next Day:</hi> Yet this <hi>Man</hi> came afterwards to be <hi>Convinced</hi> of the <hi>Truth,</hi> ſo far as to be <hi>loving</hi> to <hi>Friends.</hi> And ſome People were <hi>Convinced</hi> there-abouts, who willingly ſate down under the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> their <hi>Teacher:</hi> And a <hi>Meeting</hi> was ſettled there in the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which has continued to this Day.</p>
            <p>After this I returned into <hi>Weſtmorland,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Weſtmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Kendal.</note> and ſpake through <hi>Kendal</hi> upon a <hi>Market-day:</hi> And ſo <hi>dreadful</hi> was the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> that was upon me, that <hi>People flew,</hi> like <hi>Chaff,</hi> before me into their <hi>Houſes.</hi> I warned them of the <hi>Mighty Day</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and exhorted them to hearken to the <hi>Voice</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in their own Hearts, who was now <hi>Come to Teach his People himſelf.</hi> And when ſome <hi>Oppoſed,</hi> many People took my part; inſomuch, that at laſt ſome of the People fell

            </p>
            <p>On the <hi>Firſt-Day</hi> after I had a very large <hi>Meeting</hi> in <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder-barrow</hi> at <hi>Miles Bateman</hi>'s Houſe, where I was moved to declare, <q>That all People in the <hi>Fall</hi> were gone from the <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>God, Righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Holineſs,</hi> and were become as <hi>Wells</hi> without the <hi>Water</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> as <hi>Clouds</hi> without the heavenly <hi>Rain,</hi> as <hi>Trees</hi> without the heavenly <hi>Fruit;</hi> and were degenerated into the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Beaſts,</hi> and of <hi>Serpents,</hi> and of <hi>tall Cedars,</hi> and of <hi>Oaks,</hi> and of <hi>Bulls,</hi> and of <hi>Heifers:</hi> So that they might read the <hi>Natures</hi> of theſe <hi>Creatures</hi> within, as the <hi>Prophet</hi> deſcribed them to the People of <hi>Old,</hi> that were out of <hi>Truth.</hi> I opened unto them, how ſome were in the Nature of <hi>Dogs</hi> and <hi>Swine,</hi> biting and rending; ſome in the nature of <hi>Briars, Thiſtles</hi> and <hi>Thorns;</hi> ſome like the <hi>Owls</hi> and <hi>Dragons</hi> in the Night; ſome like the <hi>wild Aſſes</hi> and <hi>Horſes,</hi> ſnuffing up the Wind; and ſome like the <hi>Mountains</hi> and <hi>Rocks,</hi> and <hi>crooked</hi> and <hi>rough Ways.</hi> Wherefore I exhorted them to <hi>read</hi> theſe things within, in their own <hi>Natures,</hi> as well as without: And that, when they read <hi>without</hi> of the <hi>wandring Stars,</hi> they ſhould look <hi>within,</hi> and ſee, how they have wandred from the <hi>bright</hi> and <hi>Morning-Star.</hi> And they ſhould conſider, that as the <hi>Fallow Ground</hi> in their <hi>Fields</hi> muſt be plowed up, before it would bear <hi>Seed</hi> to them; ſo muſt the <hi>Fallow Ground</hi> of their <hi>Hearts</hi> be plowed up, before they could bear <hi>Seed</hi> to <hi>God.</hi> Now all theſe <hi>Names</hi> and <hi>Things,</hi> I ſhewed them, were ſpoken of and to <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Woman,</hi> ſince they fell from the <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> but as they do come to be renewed again into the <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> they come out of the <hi>Natures</hi> of theſe things, and ſo out of the <hi>Names</hi> thereof.</q> Many more ſuch things were declared to them, and they were turned to the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> by which they might come to know <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and to receive him; and might witneſs him to be their <hi>Subſtance</hi> and their <hi>Way,</hi> their <hi>Salvation</hi> and true <hi>Teacher.</hi> And many were <hi>Convinced</hi> at that Time.</p>
            <p>Now after I had travelled up and down in thoſe Countries, and had had great <hi>Meetings,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Swarth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. Ulverſton.</note> I came to <hi>Swarthmore</hi> again. And when I had viſited <hi>Friends</hi> a while in thoſe Parts; I heard of a great <hi>Meeting</hi> the <hi>Prieſts</hi> were to have at <hi>

And though <hi>Lampit</hi> (the <hi>Priest</hi> of the Place) had been at variance with moſt of the <hi>Prieſts</hi> before; yet againſt the <hi>Truth he</hi> and <hi>they</hi> all joined together. But the mighty <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> was over all; and ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful was the <hi>Appearance</hi> thereof, that <hi>Priest Bennet</hi> ſaid, <hi>The Church ſhook;</hi> Inſomuch that he was <hi>afraid,</hi> and <hi>trembled:</hi> and after he had ſpoken a <hi>few Confuſed Words,</hi> he haſtened out, for fear the <hi>Steeple-houſe would fall on his Head.</hi> There were many <hi>Prieſts</hi> got together there; yet they had no <hi>Power</hi> as yet, to <hi>Perſecute.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="83" facs="tcp:51448:76"/>
            <p>When I had cleared my Conſcience amongſt them, I went up to <hi>Swarthmore</hi> again; whither came up four or five of the <hi>Prieſts:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1652. Swarth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</note> And coming to diſcourſe, I asked them; <hi>Whether any one of them could ſay, he ever had the</hi> Word <hi>of the</hi> Lord <hi>to go and ſpeak to ſuch or ſuch a People?</hi> None of them durſt ſay, He had: But one of them burſt out into a Paſſion, and ſaid, <hi>He could ſpeak his Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, as well as I.</hi> I told him, <hi>Experience</hi> was one thing: but to receive and go with a <hi>Meſſage,</hi> and to have a <hi>Word</hi> from the <hi>Lord,</hi> as the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had and did, and as I had done to them; this was another thing. And therefore I put it to them again; <hi>Could any of them ſay, he had ever had a Command or</hi> Word <hi>from the</hi> Lord <hi>immediately at any time?</hi> but none of them could ſay ſo. Then I told them; The <hi>falſe Prophets,</hi> and <hi>falſe Apoſtles,</hi> and <hi>Antichriſts</hi> could uſe the <hi>Words</hi> of the true <hi>Prophets,</hi> and true <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and of <hi>Christ,</hi> and would ſpeak of other Mens <hi>Experiences;</hi> though they themſelves never knew nor heard the <hi>Voice</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt:</hi> and ſuch as <hi>They,</hi> might get the good <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Experiences</hi> of others: This puzzled them much, and laid them open. For at another time, when I was diſcourſing with ſeveral <hi>Prieſts</hi> at <hi>Judge Fell</hi>'s Houſe, and he was by, I asked them the ſame Queſtion, <hi>Whether any of them ever heard the Voice of God or Christ, to bid him go to ſuch or ſuch a People, to declare his Word or Meſſage unto them?</hi> for any one (I told them) any that could but <hi>read,</hi> might declare the <hi>Experiences</hi> of the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> which were recorded in the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> Hereupon one of them, whoſe Name was <hi>Thomas Taylor,</hi> an anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Prieſt,</hi> did ingenuouſly Confeſs before <hi>Judge Fell, That he had never heard the Voice of God, nor of Chriſt, to ſend him to any People; but he ſpake his</hi> Experiences, <hi>and the</hi> Experiences <hi>of the</hi> Saints <hi>in former Ages; and That he preached.</hi> This very much Confirmed <hi>Judge Fell</hi> in the <hi>Perſwaſion</hi> he had, <hi>That the Prieſts were wrong;</hi> for he had thought formerly, as the generality of People then did, <hi>That they were ſent from God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Thomas Taylor</hi> was <hi>Convinced</hi> at this time,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Weſtmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Croſs-land.</note> and traveled with me into <hi>Weſtmorland.</hi> And coming to <hi>Croſsland-Steeple-houſe,</hi> we found the <hi>People</hi> gathered together there. And the <hi>Lord</hi> opened <hi>Thomas Taylor</hi>'s Mouth amongſt the People (though he was <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced</hi> but <hi>the day before</hi>) ſo that he declared amongſt them, <hi>How he had been, before he was Convinced;</hi> and like the good <hi>Scribe,</hi> that was <hi>Converted</hi> to the Kingdom, he brought forth <hi>things new</hi> and <hi>old</hi> to the People, and ſhewed them, <hi>how the</hi> Prieſts <hi>were out of the Way:</hi> Which did torment the <hi>Prieſts.</hi> Some little diſcourſe I had with them, but they ſled away; and a precious <hi>Meeting</hi> there was, wherein the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> was over all, and the People were directed to the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> by which they might come to know <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and to underſtand the <hi>Scriptures</hi> aright. After this I paſſed on, viſiting <hi>Friends,</hi> and had very large <hi>Meetings</hi> in <hi>Weſtmorland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now began the <hi>Prieſts</hi> to <hi>Rage</hi> more and more, and as much as they could to ſtir up <hi>Perſecution.</hi> Whereupon <hi>James Naylor</hi> and <hi>Francis Howgill</hi> were caſt into <hi>Priſon</hi> in <hi>Appleby-Jail,</hi> at the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the malicious <hi>Prieſts;</hi> ſome of whom propheſied, <hi>That within a Month we ſhould be all ſcattered again, and come to nothing.</hi>

Then on a ſudden the <hi>People</hi> were in a <hi>Rage;</hi> and they fell upon me in the <hi>Steeple-houſe</hi> before his Face, and <hi>knock'd</hi> me down, and <hi>kicked</hi> me, and <hi>trampled</hi> upon me, he looking on: And ſo great was the <hi>

            </p>
            <p>The next Morning I went over in a <hi>Boat</hi> to <hi>James Lancaſter</hi>'s; and as ſoon as I came to Land, there ruſhed out about <hi>Forty Men</hi> with <hi>Staves, Clubs</hi> and <hi>Fiſhing-poles;</hi> and fell upon me, <hi>beating</hi> and <hi>punch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> me, and endeavoured to <hi>thruſt</hi> me backward into the <hi>Sea.</hi> And when they had <hi>thruſt</hi> me almoſt into the <hi>Sea,</hi> and I ſaw, they would have <hi>knock'd</hi> me <hi>down</hi> there in the <hi>Sea,</hi> I went up into the <hi>Middle</hi> of them: but they laid at me again, and <hi>knock'd</hi> me <hi>down,</hi> and <hi>ſtunn'd</hi> me. When I came to my ſelf, I looked up and ſaw <hi>James Lancaſter</hi>'s Wife <hi>throwing Stones at my Face,</hi> and her Husband <hi>James Lancaſter,</hi> was lying over me, to keep the <hi>Blows</hi> and the <hi>Stones</hi> from off me. For the People had perſuaded <hi>James Lancaſter</hi>'s <hi>Wife,</hi> that I had bewitched her <hi>Husband;</hi> and had promiſed her, <hi>That if ſhe would let them know, when I came thither, they would be my death.</hi> And having got knowledge of my Coming, many of the Town roſe up in this manner with <hi>Clubs</hi> and <hi>Staves</hi> to <hi>kill</hi> me: but the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> preſerved me, that they could not take away my <hi>Life.</hi> At length I got up upon my Feet; but they <hi>beat</hi> me <hi>down</hi> again into the <hi>Boat:</hi> which <hi>James Lancaſter</hi> obſerving, he preſently came into the <hi>Boat</hi> to me, and ſet me over the <hi>Water</hi> from them; but while we were on the <hi>Water</hi> within their <hi>Reach,</hi> they <hi>ſtruck</hi> at us with <hi>long Poles,</hi> and threw <hi>Stones</hi> after us.

That which I was moved to declare, was this: <q>That the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> were given forth by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> and all People muſt firſt come to the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in themſelves, by which they might know <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> of whom the <hi>Prophets</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> learnt; and by the ſame <hi>Spirit</hi> know the <hi>Holy Scriptures:</hi> for as the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> was in them, that gave forth the <hi>Scriptures;</hi> ſo the ſame <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> muſt be in all them, that come to know and underſtand the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> By which <hi>Spirit</hi> they might have Fellowſhip with the <hi>Son,</hi> and with the <hi>Father,</hi> and with the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and with one another: And without this <hi>Spirit</hi> they can know neither <hi>God,</hi> nor <hi>Chriſt,</hi> nor the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> nor have right Fellowſhip one with another.</q> I had no ſooner ſpoken theſe Words, but about <hi>half</hi> a <hi>dozen Prieſts,</hi> that ſtood behind my Back, burſt out into a <hi>paſſion;</hi> and one of them, whoſe Name was <hi>Jackus,</hi> amongſt other things that he ſpake againſt the <hi>Truth,</hi> ſaid: <hi>That the Spirit and the Letter were inſeparable.</hi> I replied, <q>Then every one, that hath the <hi>Letter,</hi> hath the <hi>Spirit;</hi> and they might buy the <hi>Spirit</hi> with the <hi>Letter</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures.</hi>
               </q> This plain diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of <hi>Darkneſs</hi> in the <hi>Prieſt</hi> moved <hi>Judge Fell</hi> and <hi>Colonel VVest</hi> to Reprove them openly, and tell them, <hi>That according to that Poſition, they might carry the Spirit in their Pockets, as they did the Scriptures.</hi> Upon this the <hi>Prieſts</hi> being Confounded and put to ſilence, ruſht out in a <hi>Rage</hi> againſt the <hi>Juſtices,</hi> becauſe they could not have their <hi>bloody Ends</hi> upon me. So the <hi>Juſtices,</hi> ſeeing the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> did not agree, and perceiving, that they were brought to Anſwer the <hi>Prieſts Envy,</hi> and finding, that all their <hi>Evidences</hi> were not ſufficient in <hi>Law</hi> to make good their <hi>Charge</hi> againſt me, they diſcharged me. And after Judge <hi>Fell</hi> had ſpoken to Juſtice <hi>Sawrey</hi> and Juſtice <hi>Thompſon</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:51448:80"/> the <hi>VVarrant</hi> they had given forth againſt me, and ſhewed them the <hi>Errors</hi> thereof; <hi>He</hi> and <hi>Colonel Weſt</hi> granted a <hi>Superſedeas,</hi> to ſtop the <hi>Execution</hi> thereof. Thus was I cleared in open <hi>Seſſions</hi> of all thoſe <hi>lying Accuſations,</hi> which the malicious <hi>Prieſts</hi> had laid to my <hi>Charge:</hi> And Multitudes of People praiſed God that day; for it was a <hi>joyful Day</hi> to many. There was <hi>Juſtice Benſon</hi> out of <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morland,</hi> who was <hi>Convinced;</hi> and <hi>Major Ripan,</hi> that was <hi>Mayor</hi> of the Town of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> who was <hi>Convinced</hi> alſo. It was a day of Everlaſting <hi>Salvation</hi> to <hi>hundreds</hi> of <hi>People:</hi> for the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the Way to the Father, and the <hi>free Teacher</hi> was exalted and ſet up, and his <hi>Everlaſting Goſpel</hi> was preached, and the Word of <hi>Eternal Life</hi> was declared over the heads of the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and all ſuch <hi>Money-Preachers.</hi> For the <hi>Lord</hi> opened many Mouths that Day to ſpeak his <hi>Word</hi> to the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and ſeveral friendly <hi>People</hi> and <hi>Profeſſors</hi> reproved the <hi>Prieſts</hi> in their <hi>Inns,</hi> and in the <hi>Streets;</hi> ſo that they fell, like an <hi>old rotten Houſe:</hi> and the Cry was among the People, <hi>That the</hi> Quakers <hi>had got the day, and the</hi> Prieſts <hi>were fallen.</hi> Many <hi>People</hi> were <hi>Convinced</hi> that day, amongſt whom <hi>Thomas Briggs</hi> was one, who before had been averſe from <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Truth;</hi> inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that diſcourſing on a time with <hi>John Lawſon,</hi> a <hi>Friend,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Perfection, Thomas Briggs</hi> ſaid to him, <hi>Doſt thou hold Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection?</hi> and therewithal lift up his Hand, to have given the <hi>Friend</hi> a <hi>Box on the Ear.</hi> But this <hi>Thomas Briggs,</hi> being <hi>Convinced</hi> of the <hi>Truth</hi> that day, declared againſt his own <hi>Prieſt Jackus;</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards became a <hi>faithful Miniſter</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and ſtood ſo to the End of his Days.</p>

Upon the <hi>ſecond day</hi> of the <hi>laſt Week</hi> my Brother <hi>George</hi> and <hi>I</hi> were at <hi>Lancaſter:</hi> There were abundance of <hi>Friends</hi> from all parts; and a great ſort, which ſided with the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> giving out, <hi>They now hoped to ſee a ſtop put to that great Work, which had gone on ſo faſt, and with ſuch Power, that their Kingdom is much ſhaken.</hi> We were called before <hi>Judge Fell, Colonel West, Juſtice Sawrey,</hi> &amp;c. to Anſwer, what was charged againſt <hi>George.</hi> There were <hi>Three Witneſſes</hi> to <hi>Eight Particulars,</hi> but they were much <hi>Confuſed</hi> in themſelves; which gave much <hi>Light</hi> to the <hi>Truth:</hi> whereby the <hi>Juſtices</hi> did plainly ſee, that it was <hi>Envy;</hi> and they divers times told them ſo. <hi>One</hi> of the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> was a <hi>young Prieſt,</hi> who Confeſſed, <hi>He had not meddled, had not another</hi> Prieſt <hi>ſent for him, and ſet him on Work.</hi> The <hi>other VVitneſſes</hi>
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:51448:80"/> were <hi>two Prieſts Sons:</hi> It was proved there by many, that heard <hi>one</hi> of them ſay; <hi>If he had power, he would make</hi> George <hi>deny his Profeſſion, and that he would take away his Life.</hi> This was a <hi>ſingle VVitneſs</hi> to one of the greateſt <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntruths,</hi> that was charged againſt <hi>George;</hi> And the <hi>Juſtices</hi> told him, <hi>That they ſaw, becauſe he could not take away his</hi> Life, <hi>he went about to take away his</hi> Liberty. There was one <hi>Priest</hi> choſen out of the whole number, as an <hi>Orator,</hi> to plead againſt us; who ſpared no pains to ſhew forth his <hi>Envy</hi> againſt the <hi>Truth:</hi> And when he could not prevail, he went down in a <hi>Rage;</hi> and there came up a <hi>Pack</hi> of them into the <hi>Room,</hi> among whom was one <hi>Jacus.

Whereupon the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> being put to <hi>ſilence,</hi> went down in a greater <hi>Rage,</hi> than before; and ſome of them, after they were gone down, being asked, what they had done, <hi>Lyed</hi> and ſaid, <hi>They could not get into the Room;</hi> thereby to hide their <hi>Shame,</hi> and keep the People in blindneſs. The <hi>Juſtices, Judge Fell</hi> and <hi>Colonel VVest</hi> were much <hi>Convinced</hi> of the <hi>Truth,</hi> and did ſet up <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Equity;</hi> and have much ſilenced the <hi>Rage</hi> of the <hi>People.</hi> Many <hi>bitter Spirits</hi> were at <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> to ſee the Event; but went home, and cried: <hi>The Prieſts had lost the day:</hi> Everlaſting Praiſes be to him, who fought the <hi>Batttel</hi> for us, who is our <hi>King</hi> for ever!

            <p>At this Time I was in a <hi>Fast;</hi> and was not to <hi>Eat,</hi> until this <hi>Work</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which then lay weighty upon me, was accompliſhed. But the Lord's Power was wonderfully ſet over all, and gave <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Friends</hi> Dominion therein over all, to his Glory: And his <hi>Goſpel</hi> was freely preached that Day, over the Heads of about <hi>Forty Hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-Prieſts.</hi> I ſtayed <hi>Two</hi> or <hi>Three Days</hi> afterwards in <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and had ſome <hi>Meetings</hi> there: And the rude and baſer ſort of People plotted together to have drawn me out of the <hi>Houſe,</hi> and to have thrown me over <hi>Lancaſter-Bridge;</hi> but the Lord prevented them. Then they invented another <hi>Miſchief,</hi> which was this: After a <hi>Meeting</hi> at <hi>Lancaſter</hi> they brought down a <hi>diſtracted Man,</hi> and another with him with <hi>Bundles</hi> of <hi>Birchen-Rods,</hi> bound together like <hi>Beſoms,</hi> with which they ſhould have <hi>whipped</hi> me: But I was moved to ſpeak to them i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the <hi>Lord's mighty Power,</hi> which chained down the <hi>diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Man,</hi> and the <hi>other</hi> alſo; and made them calm and quiet. Then I bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> him, throw his <hi>Rods</hi> into the <hi>Fire,</hi> and <hi>burn</hi> them; and he did ſo. Thus the Lord's Power being over them, they departed quietly.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> fretting to ſee themſelves overthrown at the <hi>Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> at <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> got ſome of the <hi>Envious Juſtices</hi> to join with them; and at the following <hi>Aſſize</hi> at <hi>Lancaſter</hi> informed <hi>Judge Windham</hi> againſt me. Whereupon the <hi>Judge</hi> made a <hi>Speech</hi> againſt me in open <hi>Court;</hi> and commanded <hi>Colonel West,</hi> who was <hi>Clerk</hi> of the <hi>Aſſize,</hi> to iſſue forth a <hi>Warrant</hi> for the apprehending of me: But <hi>Colonel Weſt</hi> told the <hi>Judge</hi> of my <hi>Innocency,</hi> and ſpake boldly in my defence. Yet the <hi>Judge</hi> commanded him again, either to write a <hi>Warrant,</hi> or go off from his <hi>Seat:</hi> Then he told the <hi>Judge</hi> plainly, that he would not do it; but that he would offer up all his <hi>Eſtate,</hi> and his <hi>Body</hi> alſo for me. So he ſtopt the <hi>Judge;</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> came over all: So that the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Juſtices</hi> could not get their <hi>Envy executed.</hi> That ſame Night I came into <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> it being the <hi>Aſſize-Time:</hi> and hearing of a <hi>Warrant</hi> to be given out againſt me, I judged it better to ſhew my ſelf <hi>openly,</hi>

            <p>From <hi>Lancaſter</hi> I returned to <hi>Robert Wither</hi>'s, and from thence I went to <hi>Thomas Leper</hi>'s to a <hi>Meeting</hi> in the Evening;<note place="margin">Meeting at <hi>T. Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.</hi>
               </note> and a very bleſſed <hi>Meeting</hi> we had there. After the <hi>Meeting</hi> was done, I walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Evening to <hi>Robert Withers</hi>'s again. And no ſooner was I gone, but there came a Company of <hi>diſguiſed Men</hi> to <hi>Thomas Leper</hi>'s with <hi>Swords</hi> and <hi>Piſtols;</hi> who ſuddenly entring the <hi>Houſe,</hi> put out the <hi>Candles,</hi> and ſwung their <hi>Swords</hi> about amongſt the <hi>People</hi> of the <hi>Houſe;</hi> ſo that the People were fain to hold up the <hi>Chairs</hi> before them, to ſave themſelves from being <hi>cut</hi> and <hi>wounded.</hi> At length they drove all the <hi>People</hi> of the <hi>Houſe</hi> out of the <hi>Houſe,</hi> and then ſearched the <hi>Houſe</hi> for me; who, it ſeems, was the only <hi>Perſon</hi> they looked for: for they had laid wait before in the <hi>High-way,</hi> by which I ſhould have gone, if I had ridden to <hi>Robert Withers</hi>'s. And not meeting with me on the <hi>VVay,</hi> they thought to have found me in the <hi>Houſe;</hi> but the Lord prevented them. Soon after I was come in at <hi>Robert Withers,</hi> ſome <hi>Friends</hi> came from the Town, where <hi>Thomas Leper</hi> lived, and gave us a <hi>Relation</hi> of this <hi>wicked Attempt:</hi> And the <hi>Friends</hi> were afraid, leſt they ſhould come, and ſearch <hi>Robert Withers</hi>'s <hi>Houſe</hi> alſo for me, and do me a <hi>Miſchief:</hi> But the <hi>Lord</hi> reſtrained them, that they came not. Though theſe <hi>Men</hi> were in <hi>diſguiſe;</hi> yet the <hi>Friends</hi> perceived ſome of them to be <hi>French-men,</hi> and ſuppoſed them to be <hi>Servants</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to one called <hi>Sir Robert Bindlas:</hi> For ſome of them had ſaid, that in their Nation they uſed to <hi>Tye the Proteſtants to Trees, and whip them, and deſtroy them.</hi> And his <hi>Servants</hi> uſed often to abuſe <hi>Friends,</hi> both in their <hi>Meetings,</hi> and going to and from their <hi>Meetings.</hi> They once took <hi>Richard Hubberthorn</hi> and ſeveral others out of the <hi>Meeting,</hi> and carried them a good way off into the <hi>Fields;</hi> and there <hi>bound</hi> them, and left them <hi>bound</hi> in the <hi>Winter-Seaſon.</hi> And at another Time one of his <hi>Servants</hi> came to <hi>Francis Flemming</hi>'s Houſe, and thruſt his naked <hi>Rapier</hi> in at the <hi>Door</hi> and <hi>Windows:</hi> But there being at the Houſe a <hi>Kinſman</hi> of <hi>Francis Flemming</hi>'s, one who was not a <hi>Friend,</hi> he came with a <hi>Cudgel</hi> in his Hand, and bid the <hi>Serving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> put up his <hi>Rapier:</hi> which when the other would not, but va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poured at him with it, and was <hi>Rude;</hi> he knock'd him down with his <hi>Cudgel,</hi> and took his <hi>Rapier</hi> from him: And had it not been for <hi>Friends,</hi> he would have Run him through with it.

And ſuch a Company of People thou deceiveſt, and feedeſt them with thy <hi>Fancies,</hi> and makeſt a <hi>Trade</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and takeſt them for thy <hi>Cloak.</hi> But thou art manifeſt to all the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Light:</hi> for that <hi>Cloak</hi> will not cover thee; but thy <hi>Skirts</hi> are ſeen, and thy <hi>Nakedneſs</hi> appears. And the <hi>Lord</hi> made one to go <hi>Naked</hi> among you, a Figure of thy <hi>Nakedneſs,</hi> and of your <hi>Nakedneſs,</hi> and as a Sign amongſt you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your <hi>deſtruction</hi> cometh; that you might ſee, that you were <hi>Naked,</hi> and not covered with the <hi>Truth.</hi> To the <hi>Light</hi> in all your Conſciences I do ſpeak, which <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> doth enlighten you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al: It will ſhew you the <hi>Time</hi> you have <hi>ſpent,</hi> and all your <hi>Evil Deeds</hi> you have done in that <hi>Time;</hi> who follow ſuch a <hi>Teacher,</hi> that acts contrary to this <hi>Light,</hi> and leads you into the <hi>Ditch.</hi> And when you are in the <hi>Ditch</hi> together, both <hi>Teacher</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, ye were warned in your Life time.

And then will you own your <hi>Condemnation;</hi> which you muſt all own, before ye can come into that bleſſed <hi>Life,</hi> of which there is no End. But ye, who hate the <hi>Light,</hi> becauſe your <hi>Deeds</hi> are <hi>evil,</hi> this <hi>Light</hi> is your <hi>Condemnation,</hi> and will be: And when your <hi>Condemnation</hi> is come upon you, remember, ye were warned.

It would teach you, both as you walk up and down about your <hi>Occaſions,</hi> and as you lie upon your <hi>Beds,</hi> and would never let you ſpeak a <hi>vain VVord:</hi> In loving it, you love <hi>Chriſt;</hi> in hating it, you bring the <hi>Condemnation</hi> thereof upon your ſelves.

                  <p>THE Word of the Lord to thee, <hi>Priest Tatham,</hi> who art found <hi>out of the Doctrine of Chriſt;</hi> having the <hi>chiefeſt Place</hi> in the Aſſembly, and being called of Men <hi>Maſter,</hi> and ſtanding <hi>Praying</hi> in the <hi>Synagogue</hi> in the Steps of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> which our Lord Jeſus Chriſt cried <hi>VVo</hi> againſt. In his <hi>VVay</hi> thou art not; but in the Way of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees:</hi> as thou mayeſt read, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. There <hi>Chriſt's VVords</hi> Judge thee, and the <hi>Scriptures</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> Condemn thee. For thou art ſuch an one, as <hi>ſues</hi> Men at the <hi>Law</hi> for <hi>Tithes,</hi> and yet profeſſeſt thy ſelf to be a <hi>Miniſter</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> which <hi>Chriſt</hi> never impowered his to do: Neither did any of his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> or <hi>Miniſters</hi> ever do ſo.

And thou art ſuch an one, as the Lord ſent <hi>Ezekiel</hi> to cry againſt, who feedeſt of the <hi>Fat,</hi> and Clotheſt with the <hi>VVooll,</hi> and makeſt a <hi>Prey</hi> upon the People. But the Lord is gathering his <hi>Sheep</hi> from thy <hi>Mouth,</hi> that to thee they ſhall be a <hi>Prey</hi> no longer. Thou <hi>Enemy</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> here this <hi>Prophecy</hi> is fulfilled upon thee, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34. and thou art <hi>one of them;</hi> I charge it upon thee in the preſence of the living God: A <hi>Hireling</hi> thou art; and they that put not into thy Mouth, thou prepareſt War againſt them.

            <p>I writ alſo to — <hi>Burton, Prieſt</hi> of <hi>Sedbergh,</hi> much what to the ſame purpoſe; he being in the ſame evil <hi>Ground, Nature</hi> and <hi>Practice,</hi> which the other <hi>Prieſts</hi> were in. Many other <hi>Epiſtles</hi> alſo and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers</hi> I writ about that Time, as the Lord moved me thereunto, which I ſent abroad among the <hi>Prieſts, Profeſſors</hi> and <hi>People</hi> of all ſorts, for the <hi>laying</hi> their <hi>Evil ways</hi> open before them, that they might ſee and forſake them; and opening the <hi>Way</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> unto them, that they might come to walk therein: which are too many and large, to be inſerted in this Place.</p>
            <p>Now after I had cleared my Conſcience at that Time, to the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>People</hi> in thoſe Parts near <hi>Swarthmore,</hi> I went again into <hi>Weſtmorland.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Weſtmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> And a Company of Men with <hi>Pikes</hi> and <hi>Staves</hi> laid wait for me at a <hi>Bridge</hi> in the Way; and they light on ſome <hi>Friends,</hi> but miſſed me.

So they went away in a great <hi>Rage,</hi> but did not hurt any Body.</p>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">1652. Grayrigg.</note>I went from the <hi>Meeting</hi> to <hi>Grayrigge,</hi> and had a <hi>Meeting</hi> there at <hi>Alexander Dixon</hi>'s Houſe; where the <hi>Prieſt</hi> (who was a <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> and a <hi>Chappel-Prieſt</hi>) came to the <hi>Meeting</hi> to oppoſe: but the <hi>Lord</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded him by his Power.

            </p>
            <p>Another Time this <hi>Prieſt</hi> came to another <hi>Meeting,</hi> and fell to <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling. Firſt</hi> he ſaid, <hi>The Scriptures were the Word of God.</hi> I told him: They were the <hi>Words</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> but not <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who is the <hi>Word;</hi> and bid him, prove by <hi>Scripture,</hi> what he ſaid. Then he ſaid, <hi>It was not the</hi> Scripture, <hi>that was the</hi> Word: and ſetting his Foot upon the <hi>Bible,</hi> he ſaid; <hi>It was but</hi> Copies <hi>bound up together.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>unſavory Words</hi> came from him: But after he was gone, we had a bleſſed <hi>Meeting;</hi> and the Lord's Power and Preſence was preciouſly manifeſted and felt among us. Soon after he ſent me a <hi>Challenge to meet him at</hi> Kendal: I ſent him Word, He need not go ſo far as <hi>Kendal,</hi> for I would meet him in his own <hi>Pariſh.</hi> So the <hi>Hour</hi> being ſet, we <hi>Met,</hi> and abundance of <hi>rude People</hi> were gathered there toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (beſides the <hi>baptized People,</hi> who were his own <hi>Members:</hi>) and they had intended to have done <hi>Miſchief</hi> that Day; but God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented them. Now when we were <hi>Met,</hi> I declared the <hi>Day</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> to them; and directed them to <hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Then the <hi>Prieſt</hi> out with his <hi>Bible,</hi> and ſaid; <hi>It was the VVord of God.</hi> I told him it was the <hi>VVords</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> but not <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>VVord.</hi> His Anſwer was, <hi>He would prove the</hi> Scriptures <hi>to be the</hi> God, <hi>before all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> So I let him go on, having a <hi>Man</hi> there, that could take down in <hi>writing,</hi> both what <hi>he</hi> ſaid, and what <hi>I</hi> ſaid. And when he could not <hi>prove</hi> it (for I kept him to <hi>Scripture-Proof, Chapter</hi> and <hi>Verſe</hi> for it) the <hi>People</hi> gnaſhed their <hi>Teeth</hi> for <hi>Anger;</hi> and ſaid, <hi>He would have me anon:</hi> But in going about to <hi>prove</hi> that <hi>one Error,</hi> he run into <hi>many.</hi> And when at length he ſaw, he could not <hi>prove</hi> it; then he ſaid, <hi>He would prove it a</hi> God: So he toiled himſelf afreſh, till he <hi>ſweat</hi> again; but could not <hi>Prove,</hi> what he had <hi>Affirmed.</hi> And he and his Company were full of <hi>wrath:</hi> For I kept his <hi>Aſſertions</hi> on the <hi>Head</hi> of him and them all; and told them, I owned, what the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures</hi> ſaid of <hi>themſelves,</hi> namely, <hi>That they were the</hi> Words <hi>of</hi> God; <hi>but</hi> Chriſt <hi>was the</hi> Word. So the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> came over all; and they being <hi>confounded,</hi> went away, and the <hi>Lord</hi> diſappointed their <hi>miſchievous Intentions</hi> againſt me: and <hi>Friends</hi> were eſtabliſhed in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and many of the <hi>Prieſts Followers</hi> ſaw the <hi>Folly</hi> of their <hi>Teacher.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this, as I came through the Country viſiting <hi>Friends, Prieſt Bennet</hi> of <hi>Cartmel</hi> ſent a <hi>Challenge to diſpute with me.</hi> Whereupon I came to his <hi>Steeple-houſe</hi> on the <hi>Firſt-Day,</hi> and there found him <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> When he had done, I ſpake to him and his People; but the <hi>Prieſt</hi> would not ſtand the <hi>Trial,</hi> but went his Way. After he was
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:51448:86"/> gone, I had a great deal of <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> with the <hi>People:</hi> And when I was come forth into the <hi>Steeple-houſe-yard,</hi> and was diſcourſing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the <hi>Profeſſors,</hi> and declaring <hi>Truth</hi> unto them; <hi>One</hi> of them ſet his <hi>foot</hi> behind me, and <hi>Two</hi> of them ran againſt my <hi>Breast,</hi> and threw me down <hi>backwards</hi> againſt a <hi>Grave-ſtone, wickedly</hi> and <hi>maliciouſly,</hi> ſeeking to have ſpoiled me. But I got up again, and was moved of the Lord to ſpeak to them. Then I went up to the <hi>Prieſt's Houſe,</hi> and deſired him to come forth, that I might <hi>diſcourſe</hi> with him; ſeeing he had <hi>Challenged</hi> me: But he would not at all come out, or be ſeen. So the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> came over them all, which was greatly manifeſted at that Time. There was amongſt the <hi>Prieſt's Hearers</hi> one <hi>Richard Roper,</hi> one of the <hi>bitterest Profeſſors</hi> the <hi>Priest</hi> had; and he was very <hi>fierce</hi> and <hi>hot</hi> in his Contention: but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he came to be <hi>Convinced</hi> of God's Eternal <hi>Truth,</hi> and became a <hi>Miniſter</hi> thereof; and continued faithful to his <hi>Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was now about the beginning of the Year 1653, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1653"/> when I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Swarthmore:</hi> And going to a <hi>Meeting</hi> at <hi>Gleeſton,</hi>

Then I departed thence, and went and viſited the <hi>Meetings</hi> of <hi>Friends</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lancaſhire</note> and ſo came back to <hi>Swarthmore</hi> again.<note place="margin">Swarth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</note> And great <hi>Openings</hi> I had from the Lord, not only of <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Spiritual Matters,</hi> but alſo of <hi>Outward</hi> Things, relating to the <hi>Civil Government.</hi> For being one Day in <hi>Swarthmore-Hall,</hi> when <hi>Judge Fell</hi> and <hi>Juſtice Benſon</hi> were talking of the <hi>News</hi> in the <hi>News-Book,</hi> and of the <hi>Parliament</hi> that then was ſitting (which was called the <hi>Long-Parliament</hi>) I was moved to tell them; <hi>That before that Day Two Weeks the</hi> Parliament <hi>ſhould be broken up, and the</hi> Speaker <hi>pluck'd out of his Chair.</hi> And <hi>that Day Two Weeks Juſtice Benſon</hi> coming thither again, told <hi>Judge Fell,</hi> That now he ſaw, <hi>George</hi> was a true <hi>Prophet;</hi> for <hi>Oliver</hi> had <hi>broken up the Parliament</hi> by that Time.</p>
            <p>About this Time I was in a <hi>Faſt</hi> for about <hi>Ten Days,</hi> my <hi>Spirit</hi> being greatly exerciſed on <hi>Truth</hi>'s behalf: for <hi>James Milner</hi> and <hi>Richard Myer</hi> went out into <hi>Imaginations,</hi> and a Company followed them. This <hi>James Milner,</hi> and ſome of his Company had true <hi>Openings</hi> at the <hi>firſt,</hi> but getting up into <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Exaltation</hi> of <hi>Spirit,</hi> they run out from <hi>Truth.</hi> I was ſent for to them, and was moved of the <hi>Lord</hi> to go, and ſhew them their <hi>Goings forth:</hi> And they came to ſee their <hi>Folly,</hi> and <hi>Condemned</hi> it; and came into the <hi>Way</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> again. After ſome Time I went to a <hi>Meeting</hi> at <hi>Arn-ſide,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Arnſide.</note> where <hi>Richard Myer</hi> was. Now he had been long <hi>Lame</hi> of <hi>one</hi> of his <hi>Arms:</hi> And I was moved of the <hi>Lord</hi> to ſay unto him amongſt all the People. <q>
                  <hi>Prophet</hi> Myer, <hi>ſtand up upon thy Legs</hi>
               </q> (for he was ſitting down:) And he <hi>ſtood up,</hi> and ſtretched out his <hi>Arm,</hi> that had been <hi>Lame</hi> a long time, and ſaid; <q>Be it known unto you, all People, that this Day I am healed.</q> But his <hi>Parents</hi> could hardly believe it; but after the <hi>Meeting</hi> was done, had him aſide, and took off his <hi>Doublet:</hi> and then they ſaw, it was true.<note place="margin">Swarth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</note> He came ſoon after to <hi>Swarthmore-Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and there declared, how that the <hi>Lord</hi> had healed him. Yet after this the <hi>Lord</hi> commanded him to go to <hi>York</hi> with a <hi>Meſſage</hi>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:51448:87"/> from him;<note place="margin">1653. Swarthm.</note> and he diſobeyed the Lord: and <hi>the</hi> Lord <hi>ſtruck him again, ſo that he</hi> died <hi>about three quarters of a Year after.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now were great <hi>Threatnings</hi> given forth in <hi>Cumberland,</hi> That <hi>if ever I came there again, they would take away my Life.</hi> When I heard it,<note place="margin">Cumberland</note> I was drawn to go into <hi>Cumberland</hi> again; and went to one <hi>Miles Wennington</hi>'s, in the ſame <hi>Pariſh,</hi> from which thoſe <hi>Threatnings</hi> came: but they had not Power to touch me then.</p>
            <p>Much about this Time too it was, that <hi>Anthony Pearſon</hi> was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, who had been an <hi>Oppoſer</hi> of <hi>Friends.</hi> He came over to <hi>Swarthmore;</hi> and I being then at <hi>Colonel Weſt</hi>'s, they ſent for me: and <hi>Colonel Weſt</hi> ſaid; Go, George, <hi>for it may be of great Service to the Man.</hi> So I went, and the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> reached him.</p>
            <p>About this Time alſo the <hi>Lord opened ſeveral Mouths to declare the</hi> Truth <hi>to</hi> Prieſts <hi>and</hi> People; ſo that divers were caſt into <hi>Priſon.</hi> And I went again into <hi>Cumberland,</hi> and <hi>Anthony Pearſon</hi> and his <hi>Wife,</hi> and ſeveral <hi>Friends</hi> went along with me to <hi>Bootle,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bootle.</note> where <hi>Anthony Pearſon</hi> left me; and went on himſelf to <hi>Carliſle-Seſſions:</hi> for he was a <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice</hi> of the <hi>Peace</hi> in <hi>Three Counties.</hi> Upon the <hi>First Day</hi> of the <hi>week</hi> I went into the <hi>Steeple-houſe</hi> at <hi>Bootle;</hi> and when the <hi>Prieſt</hi> had done, I began to ſpeak. But the <hi>People</hi> were exceeding <hi>rude,</hi> and <hi>ſtruck</hi> and <hi>beat</hi> me in the <hi>Steeple-houſe-yard:</hi> One gave me a very great <hi>blow</hi> over my <hi>Wrist,</hi> ſo that the People thought, he had <hi>bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken</hi> my <hi>Hand</hi> to Pieces. The <hi>Conſtable</hi> was very willing to have kept the Peace, and would have ſet ſome of them by the Heels, that <hi>ſtruck</hi> me, if I would have given way to it. After my <hi>Service</hi> at that time amongſt them was over, I went to <hi>Joſeph Nicholſon</hi>'s Houſe; and the Conſtable went a little way with us, to keep off the <hi>rude Multitude</hi> from us. In the <hi>Afternoon</hi> I went up again; and then the <hi>Priest</hi> had got <hi>another Prieſt</hi> to help him, one that came from <hi>London,</hi> and was highly accounted of. Before I went into the <hi>Steeple-houſe,</hi> I ſate a little upon the <hi>Croſs,</hi> and <hi>Friends</hi> with me; but the <hi>Friends</hi> were moved to go into the <hi>Steeple-houſe,</hi> and I went in after them. The <hi>London-priest</hi> was <hi>preaching;</hi> who gathered up all the <hi>Scriptures</hi> he could think of, that ſpake of <hi>falſe Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Antichriſts,</hi> and <hi>Deceivers,</hi> and threw them upon us: But when he had done, I <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected</hi> all thoſe <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and brought them <hi>back upon himſelf.</hi> Then the <hi>People</hi> fell upon me in a <hi>rude manner;</hi> but the <hi>Conſtable</hi> charged them to keep the <hi>Peace,</hi> and ſo made them quiet again. Then the <hi>Prieſt</hi> began to <hi>Rage,</hi> and ſaid; <hi>I muſt not ſpeak there:</hi> I told him, he had his <hi>Hour-Glaſs,</hi> by which he had preached; and he having done, the <hi>Time</hi> was <hi>free</hi> for me, as well as for him: for he was but a <hi>Stranger</hi> there himſelf. So I opened the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to them, and let them ſee, <q>That thoſe <hi>Scriptures,</hi> that ſpake of the <hi>falſe Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Antichrists</hi> and <hi>Deceivers,</hi> deſcribed them and their Generation, and belonged to them, who were found walking in their <hi>Steps,</hi> and bringing forth their <hi>Fruits;</hi> and not unto us, who were not guilty of ſuch things. And I manifeſted to them, that they were out of the <hi>Steps</hi> of the true <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> and ſhewed them clearly by the <hi>Fruits</hi> and <hi>Marks,</hi> that they were of thoſe, whom thoſe <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures</hi> ſpake of, and not <hi>we.</hi> And I declared the <hi>Truth,</hi> and the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> to the People, and directed them to <hi>Chriſt</hi> their
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:51448:87"/> 
                  <hi>Teacher.</hi>
               </q> And all was quiet, while I was ſpeaking:<note place="margin">1653. Bootel.</note> But when I had done, and was come forth, the <hi>Prieſts</hi> were both of them in ſuch a <hi>Fret</hi> and <hi>Rage,</hi> that they <hi>foamed</hi> at the <hi>Mouth</hi> for Anger againſt me. The <hi>Prieſt</hi> of the <hi>Place</hi> made an <hi>Oration</hi> to the People in the <hi>Steeple-houſe-Yard,</hi> and ſaid; <hi>This Man hath gotten all the honeſt Men and Women in</hi> Lancaſhire <hi>to him; and now,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>he comes here to do the ſame.</hi> Then ſaid I unto him, <q>What wilt thou have left? And what have the <hi>Prieſts</hi> left them, but ſuch as <hi>themſelves?</hi> For if it be the <hi>Honeſt,</hi> that receive the <hi>Truth,</hi> and are turned to <hi>Chriſt;</hi> then it muſt be the <hi>Diſhoneſt,</hi> that follow <hi>thee,</hi> and ſuch as thou art.</q> Some alſo of the <hi>Prieſt's</hi> People did begin to plead for their <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and for <hi>Tithes.</hi> But I told them, It were better for them to plead for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who had ended the <hi>Tithing-Prieſthood</hi> and the <hi>Tithes,</hi> and had ſent forth his <hi>Miniſters</hi> to <hi>give freely,</hi> as they had <hi>received freely.</hi> So the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> came over them all, and put them to <hi>Silence;</hi> and reſtrained the <hi>rude People,</hi> that they could not do the <hi>Mischief</hi> they intended. And when I came down again to <hi>Joſeph Nicholſon</hi>'s Houſe, I ſaw a great <hi>hole</hi> in my <hi>Coat,</hi> which was cut with a <hi>Knife;</hi> but it was not cut through my <hi>Doublet,</hi> for the <hi>Lord</hi> had prevented their <hi>Mischief.</hi> And the <hi>next day</hi> there was a <hi>rude, wicked Man</hi> would have done Violence to a <hi>Friend;</hi> but the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> ſtopt him.</p>
            <p>Now was I moved to ſend <hi>James Lancaſter,</hi> to Appoint a <hi>Meeting</hi> at one <hi>John VVilkinſon</hi>'s <hi>Steeple-houſe</hi> near <hi>Cockermouth;</hi> who was a <hi>Preacher</hi> in great repute, and had <hi>three Pariſhes</hi> under him; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſtaid at <hi>Milholm</hi> in <hi>Bootel,</hi> till he came back again. In the mean time ſome of thoſe they called the <hi>Gentry</hi> of the <hi>Country,</hi> had made a <hi>Plot</hi> againſt me, and had given a <hi>little Boy</hi> a <hi>Rapier,</hi> for him to do me a <hi>Mischief</hi> with it. And they came with the <hi>Boy</hi> to <hi>Joſeph Nicholſon</hi>'s Houſe to ſeek me: but the <hi>Lord</hi> had ſo ordered it, that I was not in the <hi>Houſe,</hi> but was gone forth into the <hi>Fields.</hi> They met with <hi>James Lancaſter,</hi> but did not much <hi>abuſe</hi> him; and not finding me in the <hi>Houſe,</hi> after a while they went away again. So I walked up and down in the <hi>Fields</hi> that <hi>Night,</hi> and did not go to <hi>Bed;</hi> as very often I uſed to do.<note place="margin">Meeting near <hi>Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ermouth.</hi>
               </note> The <hi>next Morning</hi> we paſſed from thence, and came the <hi>next day</hi> to the <hi>Steeple-houſe,</hi> where <hi>James Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter</hi> had appointed the <hi>Meeting.</hi> There were at this <hi>Meeting Twelve Soldiers</hi> and their <hi>VVives,</hi> who were come thither from <hi>Carliſle;</hi> and the <hi>Country-People</hi> came in, like as it had been to a <hi>Fair.</hi> I lay at an Houſe ſomewhat ſhort of the Place, ſo that many <hi>Friends</hi> were got thither before me. And when I came there, I found <hi>James Lancaſter</hi> ſpeaking under a <hi>Yew-Tree;</hi> which was ſo full of <hi>People,</hi> that I feared, they would break it down. I looked about for a <hi>place</hi> to ſtand upon, to ſpeak unto the People: for they lay all up and down, like <hi>People</hi> at a <hi>Leaguer.</hi> But after a while, that I was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, a <hi>Profeſſor</hi> came to me and asked; If I would not go into the <hi>Church?</hi> I ſeeing, there was no <hi>place</hi> abroad convenient to ſpeak to the <hi>People</hi> from, told him, <hi>Yes:</hi> Whereupon the <hi>People</hi> ruſhed in; ſo that when I came in, the <hi>Houſe</hi> and <hi>Pulpit</hi> was ſo full of People, that I had much ado to get in: and they that could not get in, ſtood

               <note place="margin">1653. <hi>A Meeting near</hi> Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ermouth.</note> When the <hi>People</hi> were ſettled, I ſtood up upon a <hi>Seat:</hi> 
               <q>And the <hi>Lord</hi> opened my Mouth to declare his <hi>Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Truth,</hi> and his <hi>Everlaſting Day;</hi> and to lay open all their <hi>Teachers,</hi> and their <hi>Rudiments, Traditions</hi> and <hi>Inventions,</hi> that they had been in, in the <hi>Night</hi> of <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> ſince the <hi>Apoſtles days:</hi> And I turned them to <hi>Chriſt</hi> the true <hi>Teacher,</hi> and to the true, <hi>Spiritual VVorſhip;</hi> directing them, where to find the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> that they might Worſhip <hi>God</hi> therein.

               </q> So when I had largely declared the <hi>VVord</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> unto them, for about the ſpace of <hi>three Hours,</hi> I walked forth from amongſt the People, and the People paſſed away very well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.

               <q>So the <hi>Lord</hi> opened my Mouth, and I declared his <hi>Everlaſting Truth,</hi> and <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> to the <hi>People;</hi> directing them to the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in themſelves, by which they might know <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and come to have heavenly <hi>Fellowſhip</hi> in the <hi>Spirit.</hi> And I declared to them, that <hi>Every one that cometh into the World, was enlightened by</hi> Chriſt <hi>the</hi> Life; by which <hi>Light</hi> they might ſee their <hi>Sins,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who was come to ſave them from their <hi>Sins,</hi> and died for them.

The <hi>Lord</hi> had given me a <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>diſcerning,</hi> by which I many times ſaw the <hi>States</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi> of <hi>People,</hi> and could <hi>Try</hi> their <hi>Spirits.</hi> For not long before, as I was going to a <hi>Meeting,</hi> I ſaw ſome <hi>Women</hi> in a <hi>Field,</hi> and I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned them to be <hi>Witches:</hi> and I was moved to go out of my way into the <hi>Field</hi> to them, and declare unto them their <hi>Conditions;</hi> tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them plainly, <hi>They were in the Spirit of Witchcraft.</hi> At another time there came ſuch an one into <hi>Swarthmore-Hall</hi> in the <hi>Meeting-time;</hi> and I was moved to ſpeak ſharply to her, and told her, ſhe was a <hi>Witch:</hi> And the <hi>People</hi> ſaid afterwards, ſhe was <hi>generally accounted ſo.</hi> There came alſo at another time another <hi>Woman,</hi> and ſtood at a <hi>diſtance</hi> from me; and I caſt mine <hi>Eye</hi> upon her and ſaid: <hi>Thou haſt been an Harlot:</hi> for I perfectly ſaw the <hi>Condition</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> of the <hi>Woman.</hi> The <hi>Woman</hi> anſwered and ſaid, <hi>Many could tell her of her Outward Sins; but none could tell her of her Inward.</hi> Then I told her, Her <hi>Heart</hi> was not right before the <hi>Lord;</hi> and that from the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> came the <hi>Outward.</hi> This <hi>Woman</hi> came afterwards to be <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced</hi> of <hi>God's Truth,</hi> and became a <hi>Friend.</hi>

            <p>From the aforeſaid <hi>Village</hi> we came up to <hi>Thomas Bewley</hi>'s, near <hi>Coldbeck;</hi>

            <p>On the <hi>Market-day</hi> I went up into the <hi>Market,</hi> to the <hi>Market-Croſs.</hi> Now the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> had both threatned, and ſent their <hi>Serjeants:</hi> And the <hi>Magiſtrates Wives</hi> had ſaid, <hi>That if</hi> I <hi>came there, they would pluck the Hair from off</hi> my <hi>Head;</hi> and <hi>that the Serjeants ſhould take</hi> me <hi>up.</hi> Nevertheleſs I obeyed the <hi>Lord God,</hi> and went upon the <hi>Croſs;</hi> and there declared unto them, <q>That the <hi>day</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon all their <hi>deceitful Ways</hi> and <hi>Doings,</hi> and <hi>deceitful Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize;</hi> and that they ſhould put away all <hi>Cozening</hi> and <hi>Cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and keep to <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Nay,</hi> and ſpeak the <hi>Truth</hi> one to another:</q> So the <hi>Truth,</hi> and the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God</hi> was ſet over them.

            </p>
            <p>On the <hi>firſt day</hi> following, I went into the <hi>Steeple-houſe:</hi> And after the <hi>Prieſt</hi> had done, I preached the <hi>Truth</hi> to the <hi>People,</hi> and declared the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> amongſt them.

At length the <hi>rude People</hi> of the <hi>City</hi> roſe, and came with <hi>Staves</hi> and <hi>Stones</hi> into the <hi>Steeple-houſe,</hi> crying; <hi>Down with theſe Round-headed Rogues:</hi> and they threw <hi>Stones.</hi> Whereupon the <hi>Governour</hi> ſent a <hi>File</hi> or <hi>two</hi> of <hi>Musketeers</hi> into the <hi>Steeple-houſe,</hi> to appeaſe the <hi>Tumult;</hi> and commanded all the other <hi>Souldiers</hi> out.

               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:51448:90"/> and they heard the <hi>VVord</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> gladly, and many received it.

            <p>While yet <hi>Friends</hi> abode in the <hi>Northern Parts,</hi> a certain <hi>Prieſt</hi> of <hi>Rexam</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> whoſe Name was <hi>Morgan Floyd,</hi> having heard <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports</hi> concerning us, ſent <hi>Two</hi> of his <hi>Congregation</hi> into the <hi>North</hi> to Inquire concerning us, and to <hi>Try</hi> us; and bring him an <hi>Account</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning us.

               </note> towards <hi>Thomas Hammerſly</hi>'s, where there came the <hi>Ranters</hi> of that <hi>Country,</hi> and many high <hi>Profeſſors.</hi> The <hi>Ranters</hi> oppoſed me, and fell a <hi>Swearing:</hi> And when I reproved them for <hi>Swearing,</hi> they would bring <hi>Scripture</hi> for it, and ſaid; <hi>Abraham, and Jacob, and Joſeph ſwore; and the Prieſts and Moſes, and the Prophets ſwore, and the Angels ſwore.</hi> Then I told them, <q>I did confeſs, all theſe did ſo, as the <hi>Scripture</hi> records; but, ſaid I, Chriſt (who ſaid, <hi>Before</hi> Abraham <hi>was, I am</hi>) ſaith, <hi>Swear not at all.</hi> And <hi>Christ</hi> ends the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and the <hi>Old Prieſthood,</hi> and the <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and reigns over the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Jacob</hi> and of <hi>Joſeph;</hi> and he ſays, <hi>Swear not at all.</hi> And <hi>God,</hi> when he bringeth in the <hi>Firſt-begotten</hi> into the World, ſaith, <hi>Let all the Angels of God worſhip him,</hi> to wit, <hi>Christ Jeſus,</hi> who ſaith; <hi>Swear not at all.</hi> And as for the <hi>Plea,</hi> that Men make for <hi>Swearing</hi> to <hi>end their Strife;</hi> Chriſt, who ſays, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> deſtroys the <hi>Devil</hi> and his <hi>Works,</hi> who is the <hi>Author</hi> of <hi>Strife;</hi> for that is one of his <hi>Works.</hi> And God ſaid, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed; hear ye him</hi> So the <hi>Son</hi> is to be heard, who <hi>forbids Swearing.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> who did hear the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and followed him, and preached him, <hi>forbids all Oaths,</hi> Jam. 5.12.</q> So the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> went over them, and his <hi>Son;</hi> and his <hi>Doctrine</hi> was ſet over them: and the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> was fully and richly preached, and many were <hi>Convinced</hi> that day.

               </q> Then he ſaid, <hi>I must not judge ſo:</hi> but I told him, <q>He that was ſpiritual, <hi>judged all things.</hi>
               </q> Then he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed. <hi>That that was a full Scripture: but Neighbours,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>This is the Buſineſs;</hi> George Fox <hi>is come to the Light of the</hi> Sun, <hi>and now he thinks to put out my</hi> Star-<hi>light.</hi> Then I told him, <q>I would not <hi>quench</hi> the leaſt <hi>Meaſure</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in any; much leſs put out his <hi>Star-light,</hi> if it were true <hi>Star-light, Light</hi> from the <hi>Morning-ſtar.</hi>
               </q> But I told him, <q>If he had any thing from <hi>Chriſt</hi> or <hi>God,</hi> he ought to ſpeak it freely, and not take <hi>Tithes</hi> from the People for <hi>Preaching;</hi> ſeeing Chriſt commanded his <hi>Miniſters</hi> to <hi>give freely,</hi> as they had <hi>received freely.</hi>
               </q> So I charged him to preach no more for <hi>Tithes,</hi> or any <hi>Hire.</hi> But he ſaid, <hi>He would not yield unto that.</hi> Then after a while the <hi>People</hi> began to be <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>rude;</hi> whereupon we broke up: Yet ſome were made <hi>loving</hi> to the <hi>Truth</hi> that Day. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we parted, I told them, <q>That (if the Lord would) I intended to be at the <hi>Town</hi> that <hi>Day Seven-night</hi> again;</q> and in the <hi>Interim</hi> I went into the Country, and had <hi>Meetings:</hi> and came thither again that Day <hi>Seven-night.</hi> Againſt that time this <hi>Priest</hi> had got <hi>Seven Prieſts</hi> to help him: for <hi>Priest Stephens</hi> had given notice at a <hi>Lecture</hi> on a <hi>Market-day</hi> at <hi>Adderſton,</hi> That <hi>ſuch a Day there would be a Meeting and a Diſpute with me:</hi> But I knew nothing of it; but only had ſaid, <hi>I ſhould be in Town that day Seven-night again.</hi> Now theſe <hi>Eight Prieſts</hi> had gathered ſeveral <hi>Hundreds</hi> of People, even moſt of the Country thereabouts, and they would have had me into the <hi>Steeple-houſe;</hi> but I would not go in, but got on an <hi>Hill,</hi> and there ſpoke to them and the People.

At laſt one of the <hi>Prieſts</hi> brought his <hi>Son</hi> to <hi>diſpute</hi> with me; but his Mouth was ſoon ſtopt: And when he could not tell, how to <hi>Anſwer;</hi> he would go ask his <hi>Father:</hi> And his <hi>Father</hi> was confounded alſo, when he came to <hi>Anſwer</hi> for his <hi>Son.</hi> So after they had toiled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they went away in a <hi>Rage</hi> to <hi>Prieſt Stephens</hi> his Houſe to <hi>drink:</hi> And as they went away, I ſaid; <q>I never came in a Place, where ſo many <hi>Prieſts</hi> together would not ſtand the <hi>Trial</hi> with me.</q> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>they</hi> and ſome of their <hi>Wives</hi> came about me, and laid hold on me, and fawningly ſaid; <hi>What might I have been, if it had not been for the</hi> Quakers? And then they fell a <hi>puſhing</hi> of <hi>Friends</hi> to and fro, to thruſt them from me, and to pluck me to themſelves. After a while ſeveral luſty Fellows came, and took me up in their Arms, and carried me into the <hi>Steeple-houſe-porch;</hi> intending to have carried me into the <hi>Steeple-houſe</hi> by Force: But the Door being locked, they fell down on an Heap, having me under them. As ſoon as I could
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:51448:101"/> I got up from under them, and got to my <hi>Hill</hi> again: Then they got me from that Place again, and got me to the <hi>Steeple-houſe-wall,</hi> and ſet me on a <hi>Baſs,</hi> like a <hi>Stool:</hi> And all the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> being come back, ſtood under with the People. And the <hi>Prieſts</hi> cried, <hi>Come, to Argument, to Argument:</hi> I ſaid, <q>I denied all their <hi>Voices,</hi> for they were the <hi>Voices</hi> of the <hi>Hirelings</hi> and the <hi>Strangers.</hi>
               </q> And they cried, <hi>Prove it, prove it:</hi> Then I directed them to the <hi>tenth</hi> of <hi>John,</hi> where they might ſee, what <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid of ſuch: for he ſaid, <q>He was the true Shepherd, that laid down his Life for his Sheep, and his Sheep heard his <hi>Voice,</hi> and followed him: But the <hi>Hireling</hi> would fly, when the Wolf came, becauſe he was an <hi>Hireling.</hi>
               </q> And I offered to prove, that they were ſuch <hi>Hirelings.</hi> Then the <hi>Prieſts</hi> plucked me off from the <hi>Baſs</hi> again; and they themſelves got all upon <hi>Baſſes</hi> under the <hi>Steeple-houſe-wall.</hi> Then I felt the mighty <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God</hi> ariſe over all (though the People began to be a little rude) and I told them, <q>If they would but give Audience, and hear me qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly, I would ſhew them by the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> why I denied thoſe <hi>Eight Prieſts</hi> or <hi>Teachers,</hi> that ſtood there before me; and all the <hi>Hireling-Teachers</hi> of the World whatſoever: and I would give them <hi>Scriptures,</hi> for what I ſaid.</q> Whereupon both <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>People</hi> Conſented. Then I ſhewed them out of the Prophets, <hi>Iſaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Micha, Malachy</hi> and other Prophets, that they were in the <hi>Steps</hi> of ſuch, as God ſent his true Prophets to Cry againſt: For, ſaid I, <q>You are ſuch, as the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> cried againſt, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. when he ſaid; <hi>The Prophets propheſie falſly, and the Prieſts bear rule by their means:</hi> which he called an <hi>horrible, filthy thing.</hi> And you are ſuch as they, <hi>That uſed their Tongues and ſaid,</hi> Thus ſaith the Lord, <hi>when the Lord never ſpake to them:</hi> And ſuch as followed their own Spirits, and ſaw nothing; but ſpake forth a <hi>Divination</hi> of their own <hi>Brain:</hi> and by their <hi>Lies</hi> and their <hi>Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> had cauſed the People to err, <hi>Jer.</hi> 14. And you are ſuch as <hi>They</hi> were, that ſought for their <hi>Gain from their Quarter;</hi> that were as <hi>greedy, dumb Dogs,</hi> that could never have enough, whom the Lord ſent his Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> to cry againſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56. And you are ſuch, as they were, who taught for <hi>handfuls of Barley,</hi> and <hi>pieces of Bread;</hi> who ſowed <hi>Pillows under Peoples Arm-holes,</hi> that they might lie <hi>ſoft</hi> in their <hi>Sins, Ezek.</hi> 13. And you are ſuch as <hi>They, that Taught for the Fleece, and the Wool, and made a Prey of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> Ezek. 34. But the Lord is gathering his Sheep from your Mouths, and from off your barren Mountains; and is bringing them to Chriſt, the one <hi>Shepherd,</hi> which he hath ſet over his <hi>Flocks:</hi> as by his Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> he then declared he would do. And you are ſuch as <hi>They, that Divined for Money,</hi> and <hi>preached for Hire;</hi> and if a Man did not put into their <hi>Mouths,</hi> they prepared <hi>War</hi> againſt him, as the Prophet <hi>Micha</hi> complained, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.</q> Thus went I on through the Prophets, too largly to be here repeated. Then coming to the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> I ſhewed from thence, that <q>
                  <hi>They</hi> were like the <hi>Chief Prieſts,</hi> and <hi>Scribes,</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> of old, ſuch as Chriſt cryed <hi>Wo</hi> againſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. And that they were ſuch <hi>falſe Apoſtles,</hi> as the true Apoſtles Cried againſt, ſuch as taught for <hi>filthy Lucre;</hi> and ſuch <hi>Antichriſts</hi> and <hi>Deceivers,</hi> as they Cried againſt,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:51448:102"/> that minded Earthly things, and ſerved not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but their own <hi>Bellies:</hi> for they that ſerved Chriſt, gave <hi>freely</hi> and preached <hi>freely,</hi> as he commanded them. But they that will not preach without <hi>Hire, Tithes</hi> or outward <hi>Means,</hi> ſerve their own <hi>Bellies,</hi> and not Chriſt; and through the good words of the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,</hi> and <hi>feigned Words</hi> of their own, they made Merchandize of the People <hi>then,</hi> as (ſaid I <hi>ye do now.</hi> So when I had largely quoted th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and ſhewed them, <hi>wherein</hi> they were like the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees,</hi> loving to be called of Men <hi>Maſters,</hi> and to go in <hi>Long Robes,</hi> and to ſtand <hi>Praying</hi> in the <hi>Synagogues,</hi> and to have the <hi>uppermoſt Rooms</hi> at Feaſts, and the like; and when I had thrown them out in the ſight of the People amongſt the <hi>falſe Prophets, Deceivers, Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and ſhewed at large, how ſuch as <hi>They,</hi> were judged and condemned by the true <hi>Prophets,</hi> by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> I directed them to the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> who <hi>enlightens every Man, that cometh into the World:</hi> that by it they might ſee, whether theſe things were not true, as had been ſpoken.</q> Now when I appealed to <hi>That</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in their Conſciences, the <hi>Light</hi> of Chriſt Jeſus in them, they could not abide to hear of it; they were all quiet till then: but then a <hi>Profeſſor</hi> ſaid; George, <hi>What! wilt thou never have done?</hi> I told him, <hi>I ſhould have done ſhortly.</hi> So I went on a little longer, and cleared my ſelf of them in the Lord's Power. When I had done, all the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>People</hi> ſtood <hi>ſilent</hi> for a time: At laſt one of the <hi>Prieſts</hi> ſaid; <hi>They would read the Scriptures, that I had quoted.</hi> I told them, With all my Heart. They began to read the 23d of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and there they ſaw the <hi>Marks</hi> of the <hi>falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> that he cried againſt. When they had read a <hi>Verſe</hi> or <hi>two,</hi> I ſaid, Take notice, <hi>People:</hi> but the <hi>Prieſts</hi> ſaid, <hi>Hold thy Tongue,</hi> George. I bid them, <hi>Read the whole Chapter throughout; for it was all againſt them:</hi> Then they ſtopt, and would read no further; but asked me a <hi>Queſtion.</hi> I told them, I would Anſwer their <hi>Queſtion,</hi> the Matter being firſt granted, that I had charged them with, <hi>viz.</hi> That they were <hi>falſe Prophets, falſe Teachers, Antichriſts</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers,</hi> ſuch as the <hi>true Prophets, Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> cried againſt. A <hi>Profeſſor</hi> ſaid <hi>Nay</hi> to that; but I ſaid, <q>
                  <hi>Yea:</hi> For you leaving the Matter, and going to another thing, ſeem to conſent to the proof of the former Charge.</q> Then I Anſwered their Queſtion, which was this; <hi>Seeing thoſe falſe Prophets were adulterated, Whether I did judge Prieſt</hi> Stephens <hi>to be an Adulterer?</hi> To which I Anſwered, <q>He was <hi>adulterated</hi> from God in his Practice, like thoſe <hi>falſe Prophets</hi> and the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </q> They would not ſtand to vindicate him, but broke up the <hi>Meeting.</hi> Then the <hi>Prieſts</hi> whiſpered together; and Prieſt <hi>Stephens</hi> came to me, and deſired, that my <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Brother</hi> and <hi>I</hi> might go aſide with him, that he might ſpeak to me in private; and the reſt of the <hi>Prieſts</hi> ſhould keep the People from coming to us.

And thou would'ſt give me a <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Words</hi> to pray by, and yet thou denieſt the <hi>Common-prayer-Book</hi> to pray by, as well as I; and I deny thy <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Words,</hi> as well as it. If thou would'ſt have me pray for thee by a <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Words,</hi> is not this to deny the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> of <hi>Praying</hi> by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> as it gave words and utterance?</q> Here the People fell a Laughing: but I was moved to ſpeak more to him. And when I had cleared my ſelf to him and them, we parted; after I had told them, <q>That I ſhould (God willing) be in the <hi>Town</hi> that day <hi>Seven-night</hi> again.</q> So the <hi>Prieſts</hi> packt away, and many People were <hi>Convinced</hi> that day: for the Lord's Power came over all. And whereas they thought to have <hi>Confounded Truth</hi> that day, many were <hi>Convinced</hi> of it; and many that were <hi>Convinced</hi> before, were by that day's work <hi>Confirmed</hi> in the <hi>Truth,</hi> and abode in it: and a great <hi>Shake</hi> it gave to the <hi>Prieſts.</hi> Yea, my <hi>Father,</hi> though he was an <hi>Hearer</hi> and <hi>Follower</hi> of the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> was ſo well ſatisfied, that he <hi>ſtruck</hi> his <hi>Cane</hi> upon the Ground, and ſaid; <hi>Truly I ſee, he that will but ſtand to the</hi> Truth, <hi>it will carry him out.</hi> So I paſſed about in the Country, till that day <hi>Seven-night;</hi> and then I came again: for we had appointed a <hi>Meeting</hi> at my <hi>Relation</hi>'s Houſe. Now <hi>Prieſt Stephens</hi> having had notice before hand thereof, had got ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Prieſt</hi> to him: and they had got a Company of <hi>Troopers</hi> with them; and ſent for me to come to them. But I ſent them word, Our <hi>Meeting</hi> was appointed; and they might come to it, if they would. The <hi>Prieſts</hi> came not; but the <hi>Troopers</hi> came, and many <hi>rude People</hi> Now they had laid their <hi>Plot,</hi> That the <hi>Troopers ſhould take every one's Name, and then command them to go home; and ſuch as would not go, they ſhould take, and carry them away with them.</hi> Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly they began, and took ſeveral Names, charging them to go home; but when they came to take my Name, my <hi>Relations</hi> told them, <hi>I was at home already:</hi> So they could not take me away that time. Nevertheleſs they took my <hi>Name:</hi> but the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> was over them, and they went away, both <hi>Profeſſors</hi> and <hi>Troopers, Crost</hi> and <hi>Vext,</hi> becauſe they had not their <hi>Ends.</hi> But ſeveral were <hi>Convinced</hi> that <hi>day,</hi> and admired the <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> This was that <hi>Prieſt Stephens,</hi> that had once ſaid of me; <hi>Never ſuch a Plant was bred in</hi> England: Yet afterwards he reported, <hi>That I was carried up into the Clouds, and found again full of Gold and Silver;</hi> and many Lies, and falſe Reports he raiſed on me: but the Lord ſwept them all away. Now the Reaſon, why I would not go into their <hi>Steeple-houſe</hi> was, becauſe I was to bear my <hi>Teſtimony</hi> againſt it, and to bring all off from ſuch Places, to the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> that they might know, their <hi>Bodies</hi> to be the <hi>Temples</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt:</hi> And to bring them off from all the <hi>Hireling-Teachers,</hi> to Chriſt their <hi>free Teacher,</hi> that had died for them, and purchaſed them with his Blood.</p>
            <pb n="136" facs="tcp:51448:103"/>
            <p>After this I went into the Country, and had ſeveral <hi>Meetings,</hi> and came to <hi>Swannington,</hi> where the <hi>Souldiers</hi> came again; but the <hi>Meeting</hi> was quiet, and the Lord's Power was over all, and the <hi>Souldiers</hi> did not meddle. Then I went to <hi>Leiceſter;</hi> and from <hi>Leiceſter</hi> to <hi>Whetſton.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Leiceſter. Whetſton.</note> But before the <hi>Meeting</hi> began, there came about <hi>Seventeen Troopers</hi> of <hi>Coll. Hacker</hi>'s <hi>Regiment,</hi> with his <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal;</hi> and they took me up before the Meeting; though <hi>Friends</hi> were beginning to gather together: for there were ſeveral <hi>Friends</hi> come out of ſeveral Parts. I told the <hi>Marſhal,</hi> 
               <q>He might let all the <hi>Friends</hi> go, I would anſwer for them all:</q> whereupon he took me, and let all the Friends go; only <hi>Alexander Parker</hi> went along with me. At Night they had me before <hi>Coll. Hacker,</hi> and his <hi>Major,</hi> and <hi>Captains,</hi> a great Company of them; and a great deal of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe we had about the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and about <hi>Meetings</hi> (for at this time there was a noiſe of a <hi>Plot</hi> againſt <hi>O. Cromwel.</hi>) And much Reaſoning I had with them about the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Christ, which enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth every Man, that cometh into the World. Coll. Hacker</hi> asked, <hi>Whether it was not this</hi> Light <hi>of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>that made</hi> Judas <hi>betray his Maſter, and after led him to hang himſelf.</hi> I told him, <hi>No:</hi> 
               <q>That was the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> which hated <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his <hi>Light.</hi>
               </q> Then <hi>Coll. Hacker</hi> ſaid, <hi>I might go home, and keep at home; and not go abroad to Meetings.</hi> I told him; <q>I was an Innocent Man, free from <hi>Plots,</hi> and denied all ſuch Work.</q> Then his Son <hi>Needham</hi> ſaid, <hi>Father, This Man hath reigned too long; it is time to have him cut off.</hi> I asked him, <q>For what? what had I done? or whom had I wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from a <hi>Child?</hi> for I was bred and born in that <hi>Country,</hi> and who could accuſe me of any <hi>Evil</hi> from a <hi>Child?</hi>
               </q> Then <hi>Coll. Hacker</hi> asked me again; <hi>If I would go home, and ſtay at home?</hi> I told him, <q>If I ſhould promiſe him ſo, that would manifeſt, that I was <hi>guilty</hi> of <hi>ſomething to go home,</hi> and make my <hi>home</hi> a <hi>Priſon:</hi> And if I went to <hi>Meetings,</hi> they would ſay, I broke their <hi>Order.</hi> Therefore I told them; I ſhould go to <hi>Meetings,</hi> as the <hi>Lord</hi> ſhould order me; and therefore could not ſubmit to their <hi>Requirings:</hi> but I ſaid, we were a peaceable People.</q> 
               <hi>Well then,</hi> ſaid <hi>Coll. Hacker, I will ſend you to Morrow Morning by ſix a Clock to my Lord</hi> Protector, <hi>by</hi> Captain Drury, <hi>one of his Life-guard.</hi> That Night I was kept a <hi>Priſoner</hi> at the <hi>Marſhalſey;</hi> and the next Morning by the <hi>ſixth hour</hi> I was ready, and delivered to <hi>Captain Drury.</hi> I deſired, he would let me ſpeak with <hi>Coll. Hacker,</hi> before I went; and he had me to his Bed-ſide. <hi>Coll. Hacker</hi> at me preſently again, <hi>To go home, and keep no more Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi> I told him, <q>I could not ſubmit to that; but muſt have my Liberty to ſerve <hi>God,</hi> and to go to <hi>Meetings.</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>Then,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>you muſt go before the</hi> Protector: Whereupon <q>I <hi>kneeled on his Bedſide,</hi> and beſought the Lord to forgive him; for he was as <hi>Pilate,</hi> tho' he would <hi>waſh</hi> his <hi>Hands:</hi> and when the day of his <hi>Miſery</hi> and <hi>Trial</hi> ſhould come upon him, I bid him, Then <hi>Remember,</hi> what I had ſaid to him.</q> But he was ſtirred up, and ſet on by <hi>Prieſt Stephens,</hi> and the other <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Profeſſors,</hi> wherein their Envy and Baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was manifeſt; who, when they could not overcome me by <hi>Diſputes</hi> and <hi>Arguments,</hi> nor reſiſt the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> that was in me, then they got <hi>Souldiers</hi> to take me up.</p>
            <pb n="137" facs="tcp:51448:103"/>
            <p>Afterwards, when this <hi>Coll. Hacker</hi> was in <hi>Priſon</hi> in <hi>London,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1654.

            </p>
            <p>Now was I carried up a <hi>Priſoner</hi> by <hi>Captain Drury</hi> aforeſaid from <hi>Leiceſter;</hi> and when we came to <hi>Harborough,</hi> he asked me,<note place="margin">Leiceſter. Harbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough. North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton.</note> 
               <hi>If I would go home, and ſtay a Fort-night? I ſhould have my Liberty,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>if I would not go to, nor keep Meetings.</hi> I told him, I could not promiſe any ſuch thing.

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>London.</hi> Charing-Croſs.</note> and lodged me at the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid</hi> over againſt the <hi>Mews</hi> at <hi>Charing-Croſs.</hi> And on the way, as we traveled, I was moved of the <hi>Lord</hi> to <hi>Warn People at the Inns and Places, where I came, of the day of the Lord, that was coming upon them.</hi> And <hi>William Dewsberry</hi> and <hi>Marmaduke Stor</hi> being in <hi>Priſon</hi> at <hi>Northampton,</hi> he let me go, and viſit them.</p>
            <p>After <hi>Captain Drury</hi> had lodged me at the <hi>Mermaid,</hi> he left me there, and went to give the <hi>Protector</hi> an <hi>Account</hi> of me. And when he came to me again, he told me, <hi>The</hi> Protector <hi>did require, that I ſhould promiſe, not to take up a carnal Sword or Weapon againſt him or the Government, as it then was; and that I ſhould write it, in what words I ſaw good, and ſet my Hand to it:</hi> I ſaid little in <hi>Reply</hi> to <hi>Captain Drury.</hi> But the <hi>next Morning</hi> I was moved of the <hi>Lord</hi> to write a <hi>Paper</hi> 
               <q>To the <hi>Protector,</hi> by the name of <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> wherein I did in the <hi>preſence</hi> of the <hi>Lord God</hi> declare, that I did deny the <hi>wearing</hi> or <hi>drawing</hi> of a <hi>carnal Sword,</hi> or any other <hi>outward Weapon</hi> againſt him or any Man. And that I was ſent of <hi>God</hi> to ſtand a <hi>Witneſs</hi> againſt all <hi>Violence,</hi> and againſt the <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> and to turn People from the <hi>Darkneſs</hi> to the <hi>Light,</hi> and to bring them from the <hi>Occaſion</hi> of <hi>War</hi> and <hi>Fighting,</hi> to the peaceable <hi>Goſpel;</hi> and from being <hi>Evil-Doers,</hi> which the <hi>Magiſtrates Sword</hi> ſhould be a <hi>Terror</hi> to.</q> When I had written, what the <hi>Lord</hi> had given me to write, I ſet my <hi>Name</hi> to it, and gave it to <hi>Captain Drury</hi> to give to <hi>O. Cromwel;</hi> which he did. Then after ſome time <hi>Captain Drury</hi> brought me before the <hi>Protector</hi> himſelf at <hi>Whitehall:</hi>
               <note place="margin">White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall.</note> It was in a <hi>Morning,</hi> before he was <hi>dreſſed;</hi> and one <hi>Harvey,</hi> that had come a little among <hi>Friends,</hi> but was diſobedient, waited upon him. When I came in, I was moved to ſay, <q>
                  <hi>Peace be in this Houſe:</hi> and I bid him, Keep in the <hi>Fear</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> that he might receive <hi>Wiſdom</hi> from him; that by it he might be ordered, and with it might order all things under his Hand to <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Glory.</hi>
               </q> I ſpake much to him of <hi>Truth;</hi> and a great deal of Diſcourſe I had with him about <hi>Reli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But he ſaid, <hi>We quarrelled with the</hi> Prieſts, <hi>whom he called</hi> Miniſters: I told him, <q>I did not <hi>quarrel</hi> with them, but they <hi>quarrelled</hi> with me and my <hi>Friends.</hi> But, ſaid I, If we own the <hi>Prophets, Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> we cannot hold up ſuch <hi>Teachers, Prophets</hi> and

               </q> Then I ſhewed him, <q>That the <hi>Prophets, Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> declared <hi>freely,</hi> and declared againſt them, that did not declare <hi>freely;</hi> ſuch as preached for <hi>filthy Lucre,</hi> and divined for <hi>Money,</hi> and preached for <hi>Hire,</hi> and were covetous and greedy, like the <hi>dumb Dogs,</hi> that could never have enough: And that they, that have the ſame Spirit, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had, could not but declare againſt all ſuch now, as they did then.</q> As I ſpake, he would ſeveral times ſay, <hi>It was very good, and it was Truth.</hi> I told him, <q>That all <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> (ſo called) had the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,</hi> but they wanted the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> that they had, who gave forth the <hi>Scriptures;</hi> and that was the reaſon, they were not in Fellowſhip with the <hi>Son,</hi> nor with the <hi>Father,</hi> nor with the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,</hi> nor one with another.</q> Many more words I had with him; but People coming in, I drew a little back: And as I was turning, he catched me by the <hi>Hand,</hi> and with <hi>Tears</hi> in his <hi>Eyes,</hi> ſaid, <hi>Come again to my Houſe; for if thou and I were but an hour of a day together, we ſhould be nearer one to the other:</hi> adding, <hi>That he wiſht me no more Ill, than he did to his own Soul.</hi> I told him, <q>If he did, he wronged his own Soul: And I bid him <hi>hearken</hi> to <hi>God's Voice,</hi> that he might ſtand in his Counſel, and obey it; and if he did ſo, that would keep him from <hi>hardneſs</hi> of <hi>Heart:</hi> but if he did not hear <hi>God's Voice,</hi> his Heart would be <hi>hardened.</hi>
               </q> And he ſaid, <hi>It was true.</hi> Then went I out:<note place="margin">

               <q>That we had forſook our own; and were not like to look for ſuch things from him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now I being ſet at <hi>Liberty,</hi> went up to the <hi>Inn</hi> again, where <hi>Capt. Drury</hi> had at firſt lodged me. This <hi>Capt.

But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he came on a time to me, and told me, <hi>That, as he was lying on his Bed to reſt himſelf in the day-time, a ſudden</hi> Trembling <hi>ſeized on him, that his Joints knocked together; and his Body ſhook ſo, that he could not riſe from his Bed: he was ſo ſhaken, that he had not ſtrength enough left to riſe.

            <p>For when I came from <hi>White-hall</hi> to the <hi>Mermaid</hi> at <hi>Charing-Croſs</hi> (which had been my <hi>Priſon</hi>) I ſtaid not long there: but went into the City of <hi>London,</hi> where we had <hi>great</hi> and <hi>powerful Meetings;</hi> and ſo great were the <hi>Throngs</hi> of <hi>People,</hi> that I could hardly get to and from the <hi>Meetings</hi> for the <hi>Crouds</hi> of <hi>People:</hi> And the <hi>Truth</hi> ſpread exceedingly. <hi>Thomas Aldam</hi> and <hi>Robert Craven</hi> (who had been <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff</hi> of <hi>Lincoln</hi>) and divers <hi>Friends,</hi> came up to <hi>London</hi> after me: but <hi>Alexander Parker</hi> abode with me.</p>
            <p>Then after a while I went to <hi>White-hall</hi> again, and was moved to declare the <q>
                  <hi>Day</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> amongſt them;<note place="margin">White-Hall.</note> and that the <hi>Lord</hi> was come to <hi>teach his People himſelf:</hi>
               </q> So I preached <hi>Truth</hi> both to the <hi>Officers,</hi> and to them that were called <hi>Oliver</hi>'s <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> who were of his <hi>Guard.</hi> But there was a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> that <hi>Oppoſed,</hi> while I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring the <hi>Word</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> amongſt them: For <hi>Oliver</hi> had ſeveral <hi>Prieſts</hi> about him, of which this was his <hi>News-monger;</hi> an <hi>envious Prieſt,</hi> and a <hi>light, ſcornful, chaffy man.</hi> I bid him <hi>Repent;</hi> and he put it in his <hi>News-book</hi> the <hi>next Week, That I had been at</hi> White-hall, <hi>and had bid a Godly Miniſter there</hi> Repent. When I went thither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, I met with him; and abundance of People gathered about me. Then I manifeſted the <hi>Prieſt</hi> to be a <hi>Liar</hi> in ſeveral things, that he had affirmed; and ſo he was put to <hi>Silence.</hi> He put in the <hi>News-book, That I wore Silver-Buttons;</hi> which was <hi>falſe:</hi> for they were but <hi>Alchimy.</hi> Afterward he put in the <hi>News-book, That I hung Ribbands on People's Arms, which made them to follow me:</hi> This was another of his <hi>Lies;</hi> for I never wore, nor uſed <hi>Ribbands</hi> in my Life. <hi>Three Friends<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> went to examine this <hi>Priest,</hi> that gave forth this <hi>falſe Intelligence;</hi> and to know of him, where he had that <hi>Information?</hi> He told them, <hi>It was a</hi> Woman, <hi>that told him ſo; and that if they would come again, he would tell them the Woman's Name.</hi> When they came again, he ſaid; <hi>It was a</hi> Man, <hi>but would not tell them his Name then; but if they would come again,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>he would tell them his Name, and where he lived.</hi> They went the <hi>Third Time;</hi> and then he would not tell, <hi>who told him: but offered, If I would give it under my Hand, that there was no ſuch thing, he would put that into the News-book.</hi> Thereupon the <hi>Friends</hi> carried it to him under my <hi>Hand;</hi> but when they came, he <hi>brake</hi> his <hi>Promiſe,</hi> and would not put it in: but was in a <hi>Rage,</hi> and threatned them with the <hi>Conſtable.</hi> This was the deceitful doing of this <hi>Forger</hi> of <hi>Lies:</hi> And theſe <hi>Lies</hi> he ſpread over all the Nation in the <hi>News-books,</hi> to render <hi>Truth Odious,</hi> and to put <hi>Evil</hi> into People's Minds againſt <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Truth;</hi> of which a more large <hi>Account</hi> may be ſeen in a <hi>Book</hi> printed ſoon after this time, for the <hi>clearing</hi> of <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> from the <hi>Slanders, Lies</hi> and <hi>falſe Reports</hi> raiſed and caſt upon them. Theſe <hi>Prieſts,</hi> the <hi>News-Mongers,</hi> were of the <hi>Independent Sect,</hi> like them in <hi>Leiceſter:</hi> But the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Power</hi> came over all their <hi>Lies,</hi> and ſwept them away; and many came to ſee the <hi>Naughtineſs</hi> of theſe <hi>Prieſts.</hi> The <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried me over all in his <hi>Power,</hi> and his bleſſed <hi>Power</hi> went over the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> Inſomuch, that many <hi>Friends</hi> about this time were moved to go up and down, to <hi>ſound forth the Everlaſting Goſpel, in most parts
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:51448:105"/> of this Nation,</hi> and alſo into <hi>Scotland;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1654. White-Hall.</note> and the <hi>Glory</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> was felt over all to his Everlaſting Praiſe. And a great <hi>Convincement</hi> there was in <hi>London,</hi> and ſome in the <hi>Protector</hi>'s <hi>Houſe</hi> and <hi>Family:</hi> I went to have ſeen him again, but could not get to him; the <hi>Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers</hi> were grown ſo <hi>Rude.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Presbyterians, Independents</hi> and <hi>Baptiſts</hi> were in a great <hi>Rage:</hi> for many of their <hi>People</hi> came to be turned to the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and ſate down under his <hi>Teachings,</hi> and received his <hi>Power,</hi> and felt it in their Hearts; and then they were moved of the <hi>Lord</hi> to declare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the reſt of them.</p>
            <p>I appointed a <hi>Meeting</hi> in the <hi>Fields</hi> near <hi>Acton,</hi> in which the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> and the <hi>Saving Truth</hi> was declared freely; and the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Power</hi> was eminently manifeſted, and his <hi>bleſſed Day</hi> exalted over all.</p>
            <p>About this time I was moved to write a <hi>Paper,</hi> and ſend it forth among the Profeſſors; a Copy of which here followeth.</p>

                        <p>ALL they, that profeſſed <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> in <hi>Words,</hi> and yet heard him not, when he was come, they ſaid; he was a <hi>Deceiver</hi> and a <hi>Devil:</hi> The <hi>Chief Prieſts</hi> were they, that called him ſo. So the <hi>Jews</hi> ſaid; <hi>He hath a Devil, and is mad; why do ye hear him?</hi> But others ſaid; <hi>Theſe are not the Words of him, that hath a</hi> Devil: <hi>Can a</hi> Devil <hi>open the Eyes of the Blind?</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> then <hi>doubted,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he were the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or no; and ſo all, like the <hi>Jews,</hi> in the Knowledge, in the Notion, that profeſs a <hi>Chriſt without only,</hi> where <hi>Chriſt is riſen within,</hi> they do not own him, but do <hi>doubt</hi> of him; though <hi>Chriſt</hi> be the ſame <hi>now</hi> and <hi>for ever.

Jeſus ſaid, For which of theſe good works do ye ſtone me? The</hi> Jews <hi>anſwered, for thy good works we ſtone thee not; but for Blaſphemy, in that thou being a Man, makeſt thy ſelf God. Jeſus anſwered them; Is it not written in your Law, I ſaid, you are Gods? and the Scripture cannot be broken. Say ye of him, whom the Father hath ſanctified, and ſent into the World, Thou blaſphemeſt, becauſe I ſaid, I am the Son of God? The</hi> Jews <hi>ſaid to him, ſay we not well, that thou haſt a</hi> Devil? Jeſus <hi>anſwered, I honour my Father, and ye diſhonour me. And they that were in the Synagogue, roſe up, and thruſt him out of the City; and took him up to the edge of the Hill, whereon their City was built, to caſt him down head-long.</hi> The <hi>Phariſees</hi> ſaid of him, <hi>He caſteth out</hi> Devils <hi>by the Prince of</hi> Devils. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was called a <hi>Glutton</hi> and a <hi>Wine-bib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, a Friend of Publicans and Sinners:</hi> But Wiſdom is juſtified of her Children.

And there was a <hi>Meeting</hi> in the <hi>Country,</hi> which <hi>Alexander Parker</hi> went to: and towards the <hi>middle</hi> of the <hi>day</hi> it came upon me, to go to it, though it was <hi>ſeveral Miles</hi> from me. <hi>John Crook</hi> went with me; and when we came there, there was one — <hi>Gritton,</hi> that had been a <hi>Baptiſt;</hi> but he was gotten <hi>higher</hi> than they, and called himſelf a <hi>Trier of Spirits.</hi> He uſed to tell People their <hi>Fortunes,</hi> and pretended to diſcover to People, when their <hi>Goods</hi> were <hi>ſtollen,</hi> or <hi>Houſes broken</hi> up, who the <hi>Perſons</hi> were, <hi>that did it:</hi> by which he had gotten into the <hi>Affections</hi> of many <hi>People</hi> thereabout. This <hi>Man</hi> was got into that <hi>Meeting,</hi> and was ſpeaking, and making an <hi>hideous Noiſe</hi> over the <hi>Young-convinced Friends,</hi> when I came in; and he bid <hi>Alexander Parker,</hi> give a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his <hi>Hope. Alex. Parker</hi> told him, <hi>Chriſt</hi> was his <hi>Hope:</hi> but becauſe he did not Anſwer him ſo ſoon, as he expected, he boaſtingly cried; <hi>His Mouth is ſtopt.</hi> Then this <hi>Gritton</hi> directed his Speech to me: for I ſtood ſtill, and heard him; and he ſpake many things, which were not agreeable to <hi>Scripture.</hi> I asked him, <q>Whether he could make thoſe things out by <hi>Scripture,</hi> which he had ſpoken?</q> and he ſaid, <hi>Yes, yes.</hi> Then I bid the People, <hi>Take out</hi> their <hi>Bibles,</hi> to ſearch the <hi>Places</hi> he ſhould quote for proof of his <hi>Aſſertions:</hi> But he could not make good by <hi>Scripture,</hi> that which he had ſaid. So he was <hi>ſhamed,</hi> and <hi>fled</hi> out of the <hi>Houſe;</hi> and his <hi>People</hi> were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally <hi>Convinced:</hi> for his <hi>Spirit</hi> was <hi>diſcovered,</hi> and he came no more amongſt them. And when his <hi>People</hi> were <hi>Convinced,</hi> and ſettled in <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Truth,</hi> they gave forth a <hi>Book</hi> againſt him; and denied his <hi>Spirit,</hi> and his <hi>falſe Diſcoveries.</hi> Many were turned to <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> that day, and came to ſit under his <hi>Teaching;</hi> inſomuch that the <hi>Judges</hi> were in a great <hi>Rage,</hi> and many of the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> in <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford-ſhire:</hi> becauſe there were <hi>ſo many</hi> turned from the <hi>Hireling-Prieſts</hi> to the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt's free Teaching.</hi> But <hi>John Crook</hi>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:51448:110"/> was kept by the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Lord:</hi> Yet he was turned out from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Juſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After ſome time I turned up through the Country to <hi>London</hi> again; where <hi>Friends</hi> were finely eſtabliſhed in the <hi>Truth,</hi> and great <hi>Comings in</hi> there were. And about this time ſeveral <hi>Friends</hi> went beyond the <hi>Seas,</hi> to declare the everlaſting <hi>Truth</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> Now when I had ſtay'd a while in the City,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Kent.</hi> Rocheſter</note> I went into <hi>Kent.</hi> And when I came to <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> there was a <hi>Guard</hi> kept to examin <hi>Paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cranbrook</note> but we paſſed by, and were not ſtopped. So I went to <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook,</hi> where there was a great <hi>Meeting,</hi> and ſeveral <hi>Souldiers</hi> were at it; and many were turned to the Lord that day. After the <hi>Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> ſome of the <hi>Souldiers</hi> were ſomewhat <hi>Rude;</hi> but the Lord's Power came over them. One <hi>Thomas Howſigoe,</hi> an <hi>Independent-Preacher,</hi> who lived not far from <hi>Cranbrook,</hi> was <hi>Convinced,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a faithful <hi>Miniſter</hi> for the Lord Jeſus. Some <hi>Friends</hi> had tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veled into <hi>Kent</hi> before, as <hi>John Stubbs</hi> and <hi>William Caton;</hi> and the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Profeſſors</hi> had ſtirred up the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> at <hi>Maidſtone</hi> to <hi>Whip</hi> them, for declaring <hi>God's Truth</hi> unto them: as may be ſeen at large in the <hi>Journal</hi> of <hi>William Caton</hi>'s <hi>Life.</hi> There was alſo one <hi>Captain Dunk Convinced</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Rumney.</note>From <hi>Ry</hi> I went to <hi>Rumney,</hi> where, the People having had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of my Coming ſome time before, there was a very large <hi>Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Thither came <hi>Samuel Fiſher,</hi> who was an Eminent <hi>Preacher</hi> among the <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> and had had a <hi>Parſonage</hi> reputed worth about <hi>Two hundred Pounds</hi> a <hi>Year;</hi> which for <hi>Conſcience</hi>-ſake he had given up: And there was alſo the <hi>Paſtor</hi> of the <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> and abundance of their People. And the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> was ſo mightily over the <hi>Meeting,</hi> that many were reached by the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and one <hi>greatly ſhaken;</hi> and the <hi>Life</hi> ſprang up in divers. <hi>One</hi> of the <hi>Paſtors</hi> of the <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> being amazed at the <hi>Work</hi> of the <hi>Lord's Power,</hi> bid one of our <hi>Friends,</hi> that was ſo wrought upon, <hi>Have a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:</hi> Whereupon I was moved of the Lord to bid him, <hi>Take heed of Hypocriſy and Deceit:</hi> and he was <hi>ſilent.</hi> A great <hi>Convincement</hi> there was that day, and many were turned from the <hi>Darkneſs</hi> to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Light</hi> of Chriſt, and came to ſee their <hi>Teachers Errors,</hi> and to ſit under the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt's Teaching,</hi> and to know him their <hi>Way,</hi> and the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Light,</hi> which God had given to be their <hi>Salvation:</hi> And they were brought to the <hi>One Baptiſm,</hi> and to the <hi>One Baptizer,</hi> Chriſt Jeſus. When the <hi>Meeting</hi> was done, <hi>Samuel Fiſher</hi>'s <hi>Wife</hi> ſaid; <hi>Now we may diſcern this day betwixt Fleſh and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and diſtinguiſh Spiritual Teaching from Fleſhly.</hi> The People were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally well ſatisfied, with what had been declared; but the <hi>Two Baptist-Teachers,</hi> and their <hi>Company,</hi> when they were gone from the <hi>Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> fell to <hi>Reaſoning</hi> amongſt the People. <hi>Samuel Fiſher,</hi> with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others, reaſoned for the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> which had been declared that day; and the other <hi>Paſtor,</hi> and his <hi>Party,</hi> reaſoned againſt it: So it divided them aſunder, and cut them in the midſt. A <hi>Friend</hi>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:51448:110"/> came and told me, that the <hi>Baptiſts were diſputing one with another;<note place="margin">1655.

            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Rumney</hi> I paſſed to <hi>Dover,</hi> and had a <hi>Meeting</hi> there;<note place="margin">Dover.</note> where ſeveral were <hi>Convinced.</hi> And near unto <hi>Dover</hi> there was a <hi>Governour</hi> and his <hi>Wife Convinced,</hi> who had been <hi>Baptiſts;</hi> and the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> thereabouts were much offended, and grew very envious: but the Lord's Power came over all. <hi>Luke Howard</hi> of <hi>Dover</hi> was <hi>Convinced</hi> ſometime before, and became a faithful <hi>Miniſter</hi> of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Returning from <hi>Dover,</hi> I went to <hi>Canterbury,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</note> where there were a <hi>few honeſt-hearted People turned to the Lord;</hi> who ſate down under <hi>Chriſt's Teaching.</hi> Thence I paſſed to <hi>Cranbrook</hi> again,<note place="margin">Cranbrook</note> where I had a great <hi>Meeting:</hi> A <hi>Friend</hi> that was with me, went to the <hi>Steeple-houſe;</hi> and was caſt into <hi>Priſon:</hi> But the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, and his <hi>Truth</hi> ſpread.</p>
            <p>From thence I paſſed into <hi>Suſſex,</hi> and lodged near <hi>Horſham,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Suſſex.</hi> Horſham.</note> where there was a great <hi>Meeting;</hi> and many were <hi>Convinced.</hi> Alſo at <hi>Stenning</hi> we had a great <hi>Meeting</hi> in the <hi>Market-Houſe;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Stenning.</note> and ſeveral were <hi>Convinced</hi> there, and thereaways; for the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Power</hi> was with us. Several <hi>Meetings</hi> I had thereabouts: and among the reſt, there was a <hi>Meeting</hi> appointed at a <hi>Great Man's Houſe;</hi> and he and his <hi>Son</hi> went to fetch ſeveral <hi>Prieſts,</hi> that had threatned to come and <hi>diſpute.</hi> But when the time came, none of them came; for the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> was mighty in us. A glorious <hi>Meeting</hi> we had; and the <hi>Man</hi> of the <hi>Houſe</hi> and his <hi>Son</hi> were vext, becauſe none of the <hi>Prieſts</hi> would come. So the Hearts of People were opened by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and they were turned from the <hi>Hirelings</hi> to <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> their <hi>Shepherd,</hi> who had purchaſed them without <hi>Money,</hi> and would feed them without <hi>Money</hi> or <hi>Price.</hi> Many that came, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to hear a <hi>Diſpute,</hi> were <hi>Convinced</hi> that day; amongſt which <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas Beard</hi> was one.</p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> came over all, and his <hi>Day</hi> many came to <hi>ſee.</hi> There were abundance of <hi>Ranters</hi> in thoſe parts, and <hi>Profeſſors,</hi> that had been ſo <hi>Looſe</hi> in their <hi>Lives,</hi> that they began to be <hi>Weary</hi> of it; and had thought to have gone into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to have lived <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately.</hi> But the <hi>Lord's Net</hi> catched them, and their Underſtandings were opened by his <hi>Light, Spirit</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> through which they came to receive the <hi>Truth,</hi> and to be ſettled upon the <hi>Lord;</hi> and ſo became very <hi>ſober Men,</hi> and <hi>good Friends</hi> in the <hi>Truth.</hi> And great <hi>Bleſſing</hi> and <hi>Praiſing</hi> the Lord there was amongſt them; and great <hi>Admiration</hi> in the <hi>Country.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Out of <hi>Suſſex</hi> I traveled through the Country, till I came to <hi>Reading;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reading.</note> where I found a <hi>few,</hi> that were <hi>Convinced</hi> of the <hi>Way</hi> of the <hi>Lord.</hi>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:51448:111"/> There I ſtay'd,<note place="margin">1655.

A glorious <hi>Meeting</hi> it was, and a great <hi>Convincement</hi> there was that day; and the People were mightily ſatisfied. Thither came <hi>Two</hi> of Judge <hi>Fell</hi>'s Daughters to me; and <hi>George Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Briſtol</hi> came with his <hi>Sword</hi> by his <hi>ſide</hi> (for he was a <hi>Captain.</hi>) After the <hi>Meeting</hi> many <hi>Baptiſts</hi> and <hi>Ranters</hi> came privately, <hi>reaſoning</hi> and <hi>diſcourſing:</hi> but the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> came over them. The <hi>Ranters</hi> pleaded, <hi>That God made the</hi> Devil: But I denied it, and told them; <q>I was come into the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Seed Chriſt,</hi> which was, before the <hi>Devil</hi> was, and <hi>bruiſed the Head</hi> of him: And he became a <hi>Devil</hi> by going out of <hi>Truth;</hi> and ſo became a <hi>Murderer,</hi> and a <hi>Deſtroyer.</hi> So I ſhewed them, That <hi>God</hi> did not make the <hi>Devil;</hi> for <hi>God</hi> is a <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> and he made all things <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>bleſſed</hi> them: But God did not <hi>bleſs</hi> the <hi>Devil.</hi> And the <hi>Devil</hi> is <hi>bad,</hi> and was a <hi>Liar</hi> and a <hi>Murderer</hi> from the beginning; and ſpoke of himſelf, and not from <hi>God.</hi>
               </q> And ſo the <hi>Truth</hi> ſtopt them, and bound them, and came over all the higheſt <hi>Notions</hi> in the <hi>Nation,</hi> and Confounded them. For by the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Lord God</hi> I was manifeſt, and ſought to be made manifeſt to the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in all; that by it, (which they <hi>vexed,</hi> and <hi>quenched,</hi> and <hi>grieved</hi>) they might be turned to <hi>God;</hi> as many were turned to the <hi>Lord Jeſus Christ,</hi> by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and were come to ſit under his <hi>Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Drayton.</note> where ſo many <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Profeſſors</hi> had formerly gathered together againſt me; but now never a <hi>Prieſt</hi> nor <hi>Profeſſor</hi> did appear. I asked ſome of my <hi>Relations, Where</hi> were all the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Profeſſors</hi> now? They ſaid, <hi>The Prieſt of</hi> Non-Eaton <hi>was dead; and there were</hi> Eight <hi>or</hi> Nine <hi>of them ſeeking to get into his</hi> Benefice. <hi>They will let you alone now</hi> (ſaid they:) <hi>for they are like a Company of</hi> Crows, <hi>when a rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Sheep is dead, they all gather together to pull out the</hi> Puddings; <hi>and ſo do the</hi> Prieſts <hi>for a fallen</hi> Benefice. Theſe were ſome of their own <hi>Hearers,</hi> that ſaid ſo of them: But they had ſpent their <hi>Venom</hi> againſt me; and the <hi>Lord</hi> delivered me by his <hi>Power</hi> out of their <hi>Snares.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then I went to <hi>Badgley,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Badgley.</note> where there was a great <hi>Meeting</hi> from many parts; many came <hi>far</hi> to it, and many were <hi>Convinced,</hi> and turned to the Lord: And they that were <hi>Convinced,</hi> came under <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Teaching, and were ſettled upon him their <hi>Foundation,</hi> and their <hi>Rock.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From thence I paſſed into <hi>Nottinghamſhire,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham-ſhire.

            <p>In <hi>Darbyſhire James Nailer</hi> met me, and told me, <hi>Seven</hi> or <hi>Eight Prieſts</hi> had challenged him to a <hi>Diſpute.</hi> I had a <hi>Travel</hi> in my <hi>Spirit</hi> for him, and the <hi>Lord</hi> anſwered me; and I was moved to bid him <hi>Go on, and God Almighty would be with him, and give him the Victory in his Power.</hi> And the <hi>Lord</hi> did ſo; inſomuch that the People ſaw, the <hi>Prieſts</hi> were <hi>foiled;</hi> and they cried, <hi>A Nailer, a Nailer hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed them all.</hi> After the <hi>Diſpute</hi> was over, he came to me again, praiſing the Lord. Thus was the <hi>Lord's Day</hi> proclaimed, and ſet over all their Heads; and People began to ſee the <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> and <hi>Slavery,</hi> they had been under to their <hi>Hireling-Teachers</hi> for <hi>Means:</hi> and they came to know their <hi>Teacher,</hi> the <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> who had bought them, and purchaſed them, and made their <hi>Peace</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and them.

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Worceſter</note>I went from <hi>Eveſholme</hi> to <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and had a precious <hi>Meeting</hi> there, and quiet.

               </q> Here the <hi>Prieſt</hi> began to <hi>Rage</hi> againſt the <hi>Light,</hi> and denied it; for neither <hi>Prieſt,</hi> nor <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor</hi> could endure to hear the <hi>Light</hi> ſpoken of.

               </q> And as for <hi>putting off our Hats,</hi> I told them, <q>That was the <hi>Honour,</hi> which <hi>God</hi> would lay in the <hi>Duſt,</hi> though they made ſo much ado about it; the <hi>Honour,</hi> which is of <hi>Men,</hi> and which <hi>Men</hi> ſeek one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and is the <hi>mark</hi> of <hi>

               </q> Then the <hi>Judge</hi> began to make a great <hi>Speech,</hi> how he <hi>Repreſented</hi> the <hi>Lord Protector's Perſon;</hi> and he had made him <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and ſent him to come that <hi>Circuit,</hi> &amp;c. <q>We deſired him then, that he would do us <hi>Juſtice</hi> for our <hi>falſe Impriſonment,</hi> which we had <hi>ſuffered Nine Weeks wrongfully.</hi>
               </q> But inſtead of that, they brought in an <hi>Indictment,</hi> that they had <hi>framed</hi> againſt us, ſuch a <hi>ſtrange thing,</hi> and ſo full of <hi>Lies,</hi> that I thought, it had been againſt ſome of the <hi>Thieves:</hi> How <hi>That we came by Force and Arms, and in an hoſtile manner into the</hi> Court; who were brought, as aforeſaid.

               </q> Then this <hi>Peter Ceely</hi> ſpake to the <hi>Judge,</hi> and ſaid; <hi>May it pleaſe you,</hi> My Lord, <hi>This Man</hi> (pointing to me) <hi>went aſide with me and told me, how ſerviceable I might be for his Deſign; that he could raiſe</hi> Forty Thouſand <hi>Men at</hi> an Hours <hi>warning, and involve the Nation into Blood, and ſo bring in King</hi> Charles: <hi>and I would have aided him out of the Country, but he would not go.

               </q> The <hi>Judge</hi> ſaid, <hi>It ſhould not be Read:</hi> I ſaid, <q>It ought to be, ſeeing, it concerned my <hi>Liberty</hi> and my <hi>Life.</hi>
               </q> The <hi>Judge</hi> ſaid again, <hi>It ſhall not be read;</hi> but I ſaid, <q>It ought to be read: for if I have done any thing worthy of <hi>Death,</hi> or of <hi>Bonds,</hi> let all the <hi>Country</hi> know it.</q> Then ſeeing, they would not read it, I ſpake to one of my <hi>Fellow-Priſoners,</hi> 'Thou haſt a <hi>Copy</hi> of it, <hi>Read</hi> it up, ſaid I. <hi>It ſhall not be read,</hi> ſaid the <hi>Judge; Gaoler,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>Take him away: I'le ſee, whether He or I ſhall be Maſter.</hi> So I was taken away; and a while after called for again: And I ſtill cried, to have my <hi>Mittimus</hi> read

            <p>When it was read, I ſpake thus to the <hi>Judge</hi> and <hi>Juſtices,</hi> 
               <q>Thou that ſay'ſt, thou art <hi>Chief-Juſtice</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and you, that be <hi>Juſtices,</hi> ye know, that if I had put in <hi>Sureties,</hi> I might have gone, whether I pleaſed; and have carried on the <hi>Deſign</hi> (if I had had one) which Major <hi>Ceely</hi> hath charged me with: And if I had ſpoken thoſe Words to him, which he hath here declared, then judge ye, whether <hi>Bail</hi> or <hi>Mainprize</hi> could have been taken in that Caſe.</q> Then turning my Speech to Major <hi>Ceely,</hi> I ſaid, <q>
                  <hi>When</hi> or <hi>where</hi> did I <hi>take</hi> thee <hi>aſide?</hi> Was not thy Houſe full of <hi>rude People,</hi> and thou as <hi>Rude,</hi> as any of them at our <hi>Examination,</hi> ſo that I asked for a <hi>Conſtable</hi> or ſome other <hi>Officer,</hi> to keep the People civil? But if thou art my <hi>Accuſer,</hi> why ſitteſt thou on the <hi>Bench?</hi> That is not a place for thee to ſit in; for <hi>Accuſers</hi> do not uſe to ſit with the <hi>Judges:</hi> Thou oughteſt to come down, and ſtand by me, and look me in the Face. Beſides, I would ask the <hi>Judge</hi> and <hi>Juſtices</hi> this Queſtion;
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:51448:127"/> 
                  <hi>Whether or no</hi> Major <hi>Ceely</hi> is not guilty of this <hi>Treaſon,</hi> which he charges againſt me, in <hi>Concealing</hi> it ſo long, as he hath done? Dos he underſtand his place, either as a <hi>Souldier,</hi> or a <hi>Juſtice</hi> of the <hi>Peace?</hi> For he tells you here, <hi>That I went aſide with him, and told him, what a Deſign I had in hand, and how ſerviceable he might be for my Deſign: That I could raiſe</hi> Forty Thouſand <hi>Men in an Hour's time, and bring in King</hi> Charles, <hi>and involve the Nation in Blood.</hi> He ſaith moreover, <hi>He would have aided me out of the Country, but I would not go; and therefore he committed me to Priſon for want of Sureties for the good Behaviour,</hi> as the <hi>Mittimus</hi> declares. Now do not you ſee plainly, that Major <hi>Ceely</hi> is guilty of this <hi>Plot</hi> and <hi>Treaſon,</hi> that he talks of, and hath made himſelf a <hi>Party</hi> to it, by deſiring me to <hi>go out of the Country,</hi> and demanding <hi>Bail</hi> of me; and not charging me with this pretended <hi>Treaſon,</hi> till now, nor diſcovering it? But I deny and abhor his Words, and am Innocent of his <hi>Deviliſh Deſign.</hi>
               </q> So, that Buſineſs was let fall: for the <hi>Judge</hi> ſaw clear enough, that inſtead of <hi>Enſnaring me,</hi> he hath <hi>Enſnared himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then this <hi>Major Ceely</hi> got up again, and ſaid; <hi>If it pleaſe you, my Lord, to hear me: This Man ſtruck me, and gave me ſuch a Blow, as I never had in my Life.</hi> At this I ſmiled in my Heart, and ſaid; <q>
                  <hi>Major Ceely,</hi> art thou a <hi>Juſtice</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> and a <hi>Major</hi> of a <hi>Troop</hi> of <hi>Horſe,</hi> and tells the <hi>Judge</hi> here in the Face of the <hi>Court</hi> and <hi>Country, That I</hi> (who am a <hi>Priſoner) ſtruck thee, and gave thee ſuch a Blow, as thou never had'ſt the like in thy Life?</hi> What!

Prithee, <hi>Major Ceely,</hi> ſaid I, where did I <hi>ſtrike</hi> thee? and who is thy <hi>Witneſs</hi> for that? who was by?</q> He ſaid; <hi>It was in the</hi> Caſtle-green, <hi>and that</hi> Captain Bradden <hi>was ſtanding by, when I 'ſtruck him.</hi> 
               <q>I deſired the <hi>Judge</hi> to let him produce his <hi>Witneſs</hi> for that: And I called again upon <hi>Major Ceely</hi> to come down from off the <hi>Bench,</hi> telling him; It was not fit, that the <hi>Accuſer</hi> ſhould ſit as <hi>Judge</hi> over the <hi>Accuſed.</hi>
               </q> Now when I called again for his <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> he ſaid; <hi>Captain Bradden</hi> was his <hi>Witneſs.</hi> Then I ſaid, <q>ſpeak <hi>Captain Bradden,</hi> Did'ſt thou ſee me give him ſuch a <hi>Blow,</hi> and <hi>ſtrike</hi> him, as he ſaith?</q> 
               <hi>Captain Bradden</hi> made no anſwer; but <hi>bowed</hi> his <hi>Head</hi> towards me. <q>I deſired him to ſpeak up, if he knew any ſuch thing: but he only <hi>bowed</hi> his <hi>Head</hi> again. 'Nay, ſaid I, ſpeak up, and let the <hi>Court</hi> and <hi>Country</hi> hear, and let not <hi>bowing</hi> of the <hi>Head</hi> ſerve the Turn. If I have done ſo, let the <hi>Law</hi> be Inflicted on me; I fear not <hi>Sufferings,</hi> nor <hi>Death</hi> it ſelf, for I am an <hi>Innocent Man</hi> concerning all his <hi>Charge.</hi>
               </q> But <hi>Captain Bradden</hi> never Teſtified to it: And the <hi>Judge</hi> finding, thoſe <hi>Snares</hi> would not hold, cried, <hi>Take him away, Gaoler:</hi> and then, when we were taken away, he fined us <hi>Twenty Marks</hi> a piece <hi>for not putting off our Hats;</hi> and to be kept in <hi>Priſon,</hi> till we paid it: and ſo ſent us back to the <hi>Gaol</hi> again.</p>
            <p>At Night <hi>Captain Bradden</hi> came to ſee us, and <hi>Seven</hi> or <hi>Eight Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices</hi> with him, who were very Civil to us, and told us; <hi>They did believe, neith<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <q>But, ſaid I, Captain <hi>Bradden,</hi> why did'ſt not thou witneſs for me,<note place="margin">1656. Lanceſton <hi>Priſon.</hi>

               <hi>Why,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>when Major</hi> Ceely <hi>and I came by you, as you were walking in the</hi> Caſtle-green, <hi>he put off his</hi> Hat <hi>to you, and ſaid,</hi> How do you Mr. <hi>Fox?</hi> your Servant Sir. <hi>Then you ſaid to him, Major</hi> Ceely, <hi>take heed of Hypocriſy, and of a rotten Heart: for when came I to be thy</hi> Maſter, <hi>and thou my Servant? Do</hi> Servants <hi>uſe to caſt their</hi> Maſters <hi>into Priſon? This was the</hi> great Blow <hi>he meant, that you gave him.</hi> Then I called to mind, that they walked by us, and that he ſpake to me as aforeſaid; and I ſpake thoſe Words to him before-mentioned: which <hi>Hypocriſy</hi> and <hi>Rotten-heartedneſs</hi> he manifeſted openly, when he complained or this to the <hi>Judge</hi> in open <hi>Court,</hi> and in the Face of the <hi>Country;</hi> and would have made them all believe, that I <hi>ſtruck</hi> him outwardly with my <hi>Hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now were we kept in <hi>Priſon,</hi> and divers People came, from far and nigh, to ſee us; of whom ſome were <hi>People</hi> of <hi>Account</hi> in the World: for the <hi>Report</hi> of our <hi>Trial</hi> was ſpread abroad, and our <hi>Boldneſs</hi> and <hi>Innocency</hi> in our Anſwers to the <hi>Judge</hi> and <hi>Court</hi> was talked of in <hi>Town</hi> and <hi>Country.</hi> Among others, that came to viſit us, there was one <hi>Humphry, Lower,</hi> a grave, ſober, ancient Man, who had been a <hi>Juſtice</hi> of <hi>Peace</hi> formerly: and he was very ſorry, we ſhould lie in <hi>Priſon;</hi> telling us, how ſerviceable we might be, if we were out of <hi>Priſon.</hi> But we reaſoned with him concerning <hi>Swearing:</hi> and having acquainted him, how they tendered the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Abjuration</hi> to us, as a <hi>Snare,</hi> becauſe they knew, we could not <hi>ſwear;</hi> we ſhew'd him, That <hi>No People could be ſerviceable to God, if they diſobeyed the Command of Chriſt:</hi> and that they, that <hi>Impriſoned</hi> us for the <hi>Hat-Honour,</hi> which was of <hi>Men,</hi> and which <hi>Men</hi> ſought for, they <hi>priſoned</hi> the <hi>Good,</hi> and <hi>vexed</hi> and <hi>grieved</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in themſelves, which ſhould have turned their Minds to <hi>God.</hi> So we turned him to the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in his Heart, and to the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> and he was throughly <hi>Convinced,</hi> and continued ſo to his <hi>Death,</hi> and was very <hi>ſerviceable</hi> to us.</p>
            <p>There came alſo to ſee us one Colonel <hi>Rouſe,</hi> a <hi>Juſtice</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> with a great Company with him; and he was as full or <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Talk,</hi> as ever I heard any Man in my Life, ſo that there was no ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him. At length I asked him, 'Whether he had ever been at <hi>School,</hi> and knew, what belonged to <hi>Queſtions</hi> and <hi>Anſwers?</hi> (this I ſaid, to ſtop him) <hi>At School!</hi> ſaid he, <hi>yes. At School!</hi> ſaid the <hi>Souldiers; Doth he ſay ſo to our</hi> Colonel, <hi>that is a</hi> Scholar? Then ſaid I, <q>If he be ſo, let him be ſtill, and receive <hi>Anſwers,</hi> to what he hath ſaid.</q> Then I was moved of the <hi>Lord</hi> ſo ſpeak the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> to him in <hi>God's dreadful Power;</hi> which came ſo over him, that he could not open his Mouth: his <hi>Face ſwelled,</hi> and was <hi>red</hi> like a <hi>Turkey;</hi> and his <hi>Lips</hi> moved, and he mumbled ſomething: but the People thought, he would have <hi>fallen down.</hi> I ſtept to him; and he ſaid, He was never ſo in his Life before: For the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Power</hi> ſtopt the <hi>Evil Power</hi> and <hi>Air</hi> in him; ſo that he was almoſt <hi>choked.</hi> The Man was ever after very <hi>Loving</hi> to <hi>Friends,</hi> and not ſo full of <hi>Airy
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:51448:128"/> Words</hi> to us; though he was a Man full of <hi>Pride:</hi> but the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Power</hi> came over him, and the reſt that were with him.</p>
            <p>Another time there came another <hi>Officer</hi> of the <hi>Army,</hi> a very <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious, bitter Profeſſor,</hi> whom I had known in <hi>London:</hi> And he was full of his <hi>airy Talk</hi> alſo, and ſpake ſlightly of the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and againſt the <hi>Truth,</hi> as Colonel <hi>Rouſe</hi> had done, and againſt the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> being in Men, as it was in the <hi>Apoſtles Days;</hi> till the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> that bound the <hi>Evil</hi> in him, had almoſt <hi>Choked</hi> him alſo, as it did Colonel <hi>Rouſe:</hi> for he was ſo full of <hi>Evil Air,</hi> that he could not <hi>ſpeak;</hi> but <hi>blubbered</hi> and <hi>ſtuttered.</hi> But from that time, that the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Power</hi> ſtruck him, and came over him, he was ever after more <hi>Loving</hi> to us.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Aſſize</hi> being over, and we ſettled in <hi>Priſon</hi> upon ſuch a <hi>Commitment,</hi> as we were not likely to be ſoon <hi>Releaſed,</hi> we broke off from giving the <hi>Gaoler Seven Shillings</hi> a <hi>Week</hi> a piece for our <hi>Horſes,</hi> and <hi>Seven Shillings</hi> a <hi>Week</hi> for our <hi>ſelves;</hi> and ſent our <hi>Horſes</hi> out into the <hi>Country.</hi> Upon which the <hi>Gaoler</hi> grew very <hi>Wicked</hi> and <hi>Deviliſh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dooms-Dale.</note> and put us down into <hi>Dooms-dale;</hi> a <hi>naſty, ſtinking Place,</hi> where they uſed to put <hi>Witches</hi> and <hi>Murderers,</hi> after they were <hi>Condemned</hi> to <hi>Die.</hi> The Place was ſo <hi>Noiſom,</hi> that it was obſerved, few that went in, did ever come out again in <hi>Health:</hi> for there was no <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Office</hi> in it; and the <hi>Excrements</hi> of the <hi>Priſoners,</hi> that from time to time had been put there, had not been carried out (as we were told) for many <hi>Years.</hi> So that it was all like <hi>Mire,</hi> and in ſome Places to the <hi>Top</hi> of the <hi>Shoes</hi> in <hi>Water</hi> and <hi>Piſs;</hi> and he would not let us <hi>Cleanſe</hi> it, neither would he let us have <hi>Beds,</hi> or <hi>Straw</hi> to lie on. At Night ſome <hi>friendly People</hi> of the Town brought us a <hi>Candle,</hi> and a little <hi>Straw;</hi> and we went to burn a little of our <hi>Straw</hi> to take away the <hi>Stink.</hi> The <hi>Thieves</hi> lay over our <hi>Heads,</hi> and the <hi>Head-Gaoler</hi> lay in a <hi>Room</hi> by them over our Heads alſo. Now it ſeems, the <hi>Smoke</hi> went up into the <hi>Room,</hi> where the <hi>Gaoler</hi> lay: which put him into ſuch a <hi>Rage,</hi> that he took the <hi>Pots</hi> of <hi>Excrements</hi> of the <hi>Thieves,</hi> and poured them down through a Hole upon our <hi>Heads</hi> in <hi>Dooms-dale;</hi> ſo that we were ſo beſpattered with the <hi>Excrements,</hi> that we could not touch our ſelves, nor one another. And the <hi>Stink</hi> Increaſed upon us; ſo that what with <hi>Stink,</hi> and what with <hi>Smoke,</hi> we had like to have been <hi>choked</hi> and <hi>ſmothered</hi> in <hi>Dooms-dale:</hi> For we had the <hi>Stink</hi> under our <hi>Feet</hi> before; but now we had it on our <hi>Heads</hi> and <hi>Backs</hi> alſo: And he having quenched our <hi>Straw</hi> with the <hi>Filth</hi> he poured down, had made a great <hi>Smother</hi> in the <hi>Place.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over he <hi>railed</hi> on us moſt <hi>hideouſly,</hi> calling us <hi>Hatchet-faced Dogs,</hi> and ſuch ſtrange Names, as we had never heard of. In this manner were we fain to <hi>ſtand</hi> all <hi>Night,</hi> for we could not ſit down; the Place was ſo full of <hi>filthy Excrements:</hi> And a great while he kept us after this manner, before he would let us cleanſe it, or ſuffer us to have any <hi>Victuals</hi> brought in, but what we got through the <hi>Grate.</hi> One time a <hi>Laſs</hi> brought us a little <hi>Meat;</hi> and he <hi>Arreſted</hi> her for <hi>breaking</hi> his <hi>Houſe,</hi> and ſued her in the <hi>Town-Court</hi> for <hi>breaking</hi> the <hi>Priſon:</hi> and a great deal of <hi>Trouble</hi> he put the <hi>Young-woman</hi> to; whereby others were ſo diſcouraged, that we had much a do to get <hi>Water,</hi> or <hi>Drink</hi> or <hi>Victuals.</hi> Near this Time we ſent for a <hi>Young-woman,</hi> one

               <q>That if all the <hi>Spirits</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils</hi> in <hi>Hell</hi> were there, I was over them in the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and feared no ſuch thing: for <hi>Christ</hi> our <hi>Priest,</hi> would ſanctify the <hi>Walls</hi> and the <hi>Houſe</hi> to us, he who bruiſed the Head of the <hi>Devil.</hi>

            <p>By this time the <hi>General Quarter-Seſſions</hi> drew nigh; and the <hi>Gaoler</hi> ſtill carrying himſelf <hi>baſely</hi> and <hi>wickedly</hi> towards us, we drew up our <hi>Sufferings,</hi> and ſent it to the <hi>Seſſions</hi> at <hi>Bodmin:</hi> upon the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which, the <hi>Juſtices</hi> gave <hi>Order; That</hi> Doomſdale-Door <hi>ſhould be opened, and that we ſhould have liberty to Cleanſe it, and to buy our Meat in the Town.</hi> We ſent up a <hi>Copy</hi> alſo of our <hi>Sufferings</hi> to the <hi>Protector,</hi> ſetting forth, how we were taken and Committed by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor <hi>Ceely;</hi> and how we were abuſed by Capt. <hi>Keat</hi> as aforeſaid, and the reſt in Order: Whereupon the <hi>Protector</hi> ſent down an <hi>Order</hi> to Capt. <hi>Fox,</hi> Governour of <hi>Pendennis-Caſtle,</hi> to Examin the Matter about the <hi>Souldiers abuſing</hi> us, and <hi>ſtriking</hi> me.

This was of great Service in the Country: for afterwards <hi>Friends</hi> might have ſpoken in any <hi>Market</hi> or <hi>Steeple-houſe</hi> thereabouts, and none would meddle with them.

               <hi>Steeple-houſes;</hi> and ſeveral were ſent to <hi>Priſon</hi> to us: and a great <hi>Convincement</hi> there began to be in the <hi>Country.</hi> For now we had <hi>Liberty</hi> to come out, and to walk in the <hi>Caſtle-Green;</hi> and divers People came to us on the <hi>Firſt-days,</hi> to whom we declared the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Life:</hi> and great Service we had among them, and many were turned to God, here and there, up and down the Country; but a great <hi>Rage</hi> got up in the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Profeſſors</hi> againſt the <hi>Truth</hi> and us. <hi>One</hi> of the envious <hi>Profeſſors</hi> had gathered together many <hi>Scripture-Sentences,</hi> to prove, <hi>That we ought to put off our Hats to the People;</hi> and he invited the <hi>Town</hi> of <hi>Lanceſton</hi> to come into the <hi>Caſtle-Yard</hi> to hear him read them: Amongſt other <hi>Inſtances,</hi> that he there brought, one was; <hi>That</hi> Saul <hi>bowed to the Witch of</hi> Endor. When he had done, we got a little <hi>Liberty</hi> (whether the <hi>Gaoler</hi> would or no) to <hi>ſpeak;</hi> and we ſhewed both him and the People, <q>That <hi>Saul</hi> was gone from <hi>God,</hi> and had <hi>diſobeyed God,</hi> like them, when he went to the <hi>Witch</hi> of <hi>Endor:</hi> That neither the <hi>Prophets,</hi> nor <hi>Chriſt,</hi> nor the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ever taught People to <hi>bow</hi> to a <hi>Witch.</hi>
               </q> The <hi>Man</hi> went away with his <hi>rude People;</hi> but ſome of the <hi>People</hi> ſtaid with us: and we ſhewed them; <q>That this was not <hi>Goſpel-Inſtructions,</hi> to teach People to <hi>bow</hi> to a <hi>Witch.</hi>
               </q> For now People began to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the <hi>Truth,</hi> and now the <hi>Devil's Rage</hi> increaſed; ſo that we were in great <hi>dangers</hi> many times.</p>
            <p>One time there came a <hi>Souldier</hi> to us; and one of our <hi>Friends</hi> was admoniſhing of him, and exhorting him to <hi>Sobriety,</hi> &amp;c. and I ſaw him begin to <hi>draw</hi> his <hi>Sword</hi> at him. Whereupon I ſtept to him, and told him, What a <hi>ſhame</hi> it was to offer to draw his <hi>Sword</hi> upon a <hi>naked Man,</hi> and a <hi>Priſoner;</hi> and how unfit and unworthy he was to carry ſuch a <hi>Weapon:</hi> and that, if he ſhould have <hi>offered</hi> ſuch a thing to ſome Men, they would have taken his <hi>Sword</hi> from him, and have <hi>broken</hi> it to <hi>pieces.</hi> So he was <hi>aſhamed,</hi> and went his way; and the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> preſerved us.</p>
            <p>Another time, about the <hi>Eleventh Hour</hi> at <hi>Night,</hi> the <hi>Gaoler</hi> being <hi>half-drunk,</hi> came and told me, <hi>That he had gotten a Man now to diſpute with me</hi> (this was, when we had leave to go a little into the <hi>Town:</hi>) As ſoon as he ſpake thoſe Words, I felt, there was <hi>Miſchief</hi> intended to my <hi>Body.</hi> All that <hi>Night,</hi> and the next <hi>day</hi> I lay down on a <hi>Graſs-plat</hi> to <hi>ſlumber,</hi> and I felt ſomething ſtill about my <hi>Body;</hi> and I ſtarted up, and <hi>ſtruck</hi> at it in the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and yet ſtill it was about my <hi>Body.</hi> Then I aroſe, and walked into the <hi>Caſtle-green;</hi> and the <hi>

Then I was moved of the <hi>Lord</hi> to <hi>ſpeak ſharply</hi> to him in the <hi>dreadful Power</hi> of the <hi>Lord:</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> came over him, and bound him down; ſo that he never after durſt appear before me, to ſpeak unto me.

            <p>By the foregoing <hi>Letter</hi> the <hi>Reader</hi> may Obſerve, how contrary to <hi>Law</hi> we were made to <hi>ſuffer:</hi> But the <hi>Lord,</hi> who ſaw the <hi>Integrity</hi> of our <hi>Hearts</hi> to him, and knew the <hi>Innocency</hi> of our <hi>Cauſe,</hi> was with us in our <hi>Sufferings,</hi> and bore up our Spirits through, and made them <hi>Eaſie</hi> to us; and gave us <hi>Opportunities</hi> of publiſhing his <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> amongſt the People: ſo that ſeveral of the Town came to be <hi>Convinced,</hi> and many were made <hi>Loving</hi> to us; and <hi>Friends</hi> from many Parts came to viſit us. There came <hi>Two</hi> out of <hi>Wales,</hi> who had been <hi>Juſtices</hi> of the <hi>Peace</hi> there: —Alſo Judge <hi>Hagget</hi>'s Wife of <hi>Briſtol</hi> came to viſit us; and ſhe was <hi>Convinced,</hi> and ſeveral of her <hi>Children:</hi> and her <hi>Husband</hi> was very kind and ſerviceable to <hi>Friends,</hi> and had a great Love to <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>People,</hi> which he retained to his <hi>Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in <hi>Cornwall, Devonſhire, Dorſetſhire</hi> and <hi>Somerſetſhire Truth</hi> began mightily to ſpread; and many were turned to <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and his free Teaching: for many <hi>Friends,</hi> that came to Viſit us, were drawn forth to <hi>declare</hi> the <hi>Truth</hi> in thoſe Countries; which made the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Profeſſors rage,</hi> and they ſtirred up the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates</hi> to enſnare <hi>Friends.</hi> Then they ſet up <hi>Watches</hi> in the <hi>Streets,</hi> and in the <hi>High-ways,</hi> on pretence of taking up all <hi>ſuſpicious Perſons;</hi>

            <p>After the <hi>Aſſize,</hi> the <hi>Sheriff,</hi> with ſome <hi>Souldiers</hi> came to guard a <hi>Woman</hi> to <hi>Execution,</hi> that was ſentenced to <hi>die;</hi> and we had a great deal of <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> with them. <hi>One</hi> of them wickedly ſaid, <hi>That</hi> Chriſt <hi>was as paſſionate a Man, as any that lived upon the Earth:</hi> for which <hi>wicked Saying</hi> we rebuked him. Another time we asked the <hi>Jailer,</hi> what Doings there were at the <hi>Seſſions?</hi> and he ſaid, <hi>Small Matters;</hi> only about <hi>Thirty</hi> for <hi>Baſtardy.</hi> We thought it very ſtrange, that they, who profeſſed themſelves <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> ſhould make <hi>ſmall Matters</hi> of ſuch things: But this <hi>Jailer</hi> was very <hi>bad</hi> himſelf, and I often admoniſhed him to <hi>Sobriety;</hi> but he would <hi>Abuſe People,</hi> that came to <hi>Viſit</hi> us. <hi>Edward Pyot</hi> had a <hi>Cheeſe</hi> ſent him from <hi>Briſtol</hi> from his Wife; and the <hi>Jailer</hi> took the <hi>Cheeſe</hi> from him, and carried it to the <hi>Mayor,</hi> to ſearch it for <hi>Treaſonable Letters,</hi> as he ſaid: And though they found no <hi>Treaſon</hi> in the <hi>Cheeſe,</hi> they kept it from us. This <hi>Gaoler</hi> might have been made <hi>Rich,</hi> if he had carried himſelf <hi>Civilly;</hi> but he ſought his own <hi>Ruin.</hi> Which ſoon after came upon him: For the next Year he was turned out of his Place, and for ſome <hi>wickedneſs</hi> was caſt into the <hi>Jail</hi> himſelf; and there <hi>begged</hi> of our <hi>Friends.</hi> And for ſome <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrulineſs</hi> in his <hi>Carriage,</hi> he was by the ſucceeding <hi>Jailer</hi> put into <hi>Doomſdale,</hi> and lockt in <hi>Irons,</hi> and beaten; and bid to <hi>Remember, how he had abuſed thoſe good Men, whom he had wickedly, without any Cauſe, caſt into that naſty</hi> Dungeon: and told, <hi>That now he deſervedly ſhould ſuffer for his wickedneſs; and the ſame Meaſure he had meted to others, he ſhould have meted out to himſelf.</hi> He grew to be very <hi>poor,</hi> and <hi>died</hi> in <hi>Priſon;</hi> and his Wife and Family came to <hi>Miſery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While I was in <hi>Priſon</hi> in <hi>Lanceſton,</hi> there was a <hi>Friend</hi> went to <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> and offered himſelf <hi>Body</hi> for <hi>Body,</hi> to lie in <hi>Doomſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale-Priſon</hi> for <hi>me,</hi> or <hi>in my ſtead;</hi> if he would take him, and let me go at <hi>Liberty.</hi> Which thing ſo <hi>ſtruck</hi> him, that he ſaid to his <hi>great Men</hi> and <hi>Council; VVhich of you would do ſo much for me, if I were in the ſame Condition?</hi> And though he did not accept of the <hi>Friend's Proffer,</hi> but ſaid, <hi>He could not do it, for that it was contrary to</hi> Law; yet however, the <hi>Truth</hi> thereby came mightily over him. A good while after this he ſent down Major General <hi>Desborow,</hi> pretending to ſet us at <hi>Liberty:</hi> And when he came, he proffered us, If we would ſay, <hi>VVe would go home, and preach no more,</hi> we ſhould have our
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:51448:142"/> Liberty; but we could not promiſe him ſo. Then he urged, that we ſhould <hi>promiſe to go home, if the Lord permit:</hi> Whereupon <hi>Edward Pyot</hi> writ him this following <hi>Letter.</hi>

Chriſt ſaith; <hi>Every idle Word, that Men ſhall ſpeak, they ſhall give Account thereof in the day of Judgment,</hi> (Mat 12.36.) <hi>So ye, that name the Name of Chriſt, depart from Iniquity,</hi> (2 Tim. 2.19.) <hi>The Son of Man ſhall come in the glory of his Father, with his Angels; and then he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward every Man according to his Works,</hi> (Mat 16.27.)

                           <p>The Apoſtle tells the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> that unto him <hi>this grace was given—to make all Men ſee, what is the Fellowſhip of the Myſtery, which from the beginning of the World hath been hid in God, who cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated all things by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> (Eph. 3.9.) Read and underſtand every one with the <hi>Light,</hi> which comes from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Myſtery;</hi> which will be your <hi>Condemnation,</hi> if ye believe not in it. This is to all, who ſtumble at the <hi>work</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>manifeſtation</hi> of it, which <hi>is given to every Man, to profit withal.</hi> Come, ye <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors,</hi> who ſtumble at it; Let us read the Parables. <hi>A Sower went forth to ſow; and ſome Seed fell on the High-way-ground,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:51448:160"/> and ſome on ſtony ground, and ſome on thorny ground: The Seed is the word, the Son of Man is the Seeds-man. He that hath an Ear, let him hear,</hi> (Mat. 13.)

And whether the <hi>wicked Seeds-man</hi> hath not got his <hi>Seed</hi> into your Ground? <hi>He that hath an Ear, let him hear it.</hi> And come, read another Parable, of the <hi>Houſholder,</hi> hiring <hi>Labourers</hi> to go into the Vineyard, and agreeing with every Man for a <hi>Penny,</hi> (Mat. 20.) Every Man is to have his <hi>Penny;</hi> the <hi>Last</hi> that went in, as well as the <hi>First:</hi> and the <hi>Last</hi> ſhall be <hi>Firſt,</hi> and the <hi>Firſt</hi> ſhall be <hi>Laſt; for many are called, but few are choſen.</hi> He that hath an Ear, let him hear. There is a <hi>Promiſe</hi> ſpoken to <hi>Cain,</hi> that if he did well, he ſhould be accepted, (Gen. 4.7.) And <hi>Eſau</hi> had a <hi>Birth-right,</hi> but deſpiſed it. Yet is it not <hi>of him that willeth,</hi> (Rom. 9.16.) <hi>but by grace ye are ſaved,</hi> (Epheſ. 2.8.) And <hi>ſtand ſtill,</hi> and ſee your <hi>Salvation,</hi> (Exod. 14.13.) And ye that be <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Light,</hi> put on the <hi>Armour</hi> of <hi>Light,</hi> that ye may come into the Unity of the <hi>Faith,</hi> and of the knowledge of the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> unto a <hi>perfect Man, unto the meaſure of the Stature of the fulneſs of Chriſt: that henceforth ye be no more Children toſſed to and fro,</hi> (Eph. 4.13.)</p>
                           <p>And the Lord ſaid, he would make a new Covenant, by <hi>writing his Law in People's Hearts, and putting his Spirit in their inward parts;</hi> whereby they ſhould all come to <hi>know</hi> the <hi>Lord,</hi> him by whom the <hi>World</hi> was made. Now every one of you mind the <hi>Law written in your Hearts,</hi> and this <hi>Spirit put in your inward parts;</hi> that it need not be ſaid to you, <hi>Know the Lord:</hi> but that ye may witneſs the <hi>Promiſe</hi> of <hi>God</hi> fulfilled in you. But, ſay the <hi>World</hi> and <hi>Profeſſors, If every one muſt come to witneſs the Law of God written in their Hearts, and the Spirit put in the inward parts; what muſt we do with all our Teachers?</hi> As we come to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that, we need not any Man to <hi>Teach</hi> us to know the Lord, having his <hi>Law</hi> written in our <hi>Hearts,</hi> and his <hi>Spirit</hi> put in our inward parts. This is the Covenant of Life, the everlaſting Covenant, which decays not, not changes not: and here is the way to the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> without which no Man cometh unto the <hi>Father.</hi> And here is the Everlaſting <hi>Prieſthood,</hi> the <hi>End</hi> of the <hi>Old Prieſthood,</hi> whoſe Lips were to preſerve Knowledge: but now ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Learn of me;</hi> who is the <hi>High-Prieſt</hi> of the <hi>New Prieſthood.</hi> And, ſaith the Apoſtle,—<hi>That ye may grow up in the Knowledge of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>in whom are hid the Treaſures of Wiſdom and Knowledge.</hi> So we are brought off from the <hi>Old Prieſthood,</hi> that did change, to Chriſt, to the <hi>New Prieſthood,</hi> that doth not change; and off from the <hi>first Covenant,</hi> that doth decay, to the Everlaſting <hi>Covenant,</hi> that doth not decay, <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Light,</hi> from whom every one of you have a <hi>Light,</hi> that ye might believe in the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Light.</hi> If ye do not believe, ye are condemned: for <hi>Light</hi> is come into the World; and Men love <hi>Darkneſs</hi> rather than <hi>Light,</hi> becauſe their Deeds are evil. <hi>I am come a Light into the World,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>that whoſoever believeth in me, ſhould not abide in Darkneſs, but have the Light of Life,</hi> (Joh. 12.46.) And, <hi>Believe in the Light, that ye may be Children of the Light.</hi> But ye, who do not believe in the <hi>Light,</hi> but hate it, becauſe it manifeſts your <hi>Deeds</hi> to be <hi>evil;</hi> ye are they, that are condemned by the <hi>Light.</hi> Therefore while ye have <hi>Time,</hi> prize it: Seek the <hi>Lord,</hi> while he may be found, and call upon him, while he is nigh; leſt ye ſay, <hi>Time is paſt:</hi> for the <hi>Rich Glutton</hi>'s <hi>Time</hi> was <hi>paſt.</hi> Therefore
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:51448:160"/> while <hi>Time</hi> is not quite paſt, conſider and ſearch your ſelves, and ſee, if ye be not they, that hate the <hi>Light;</hi> and ſo are <hi>Builders,</hi> that ſtumble at the <hi>Corner-ſtone:</hi> for they that hated the <hi>Light,</hi> and did not believe in the <hi>Light,</hi> did ſo in Ages paſt. <hi>I am the Light of the World,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>and who doth enlighten every Man, that cometh into the World:</hi> and he alſo ſaith, <hi>Learn of me;</hi> and of him God ſaith, <hi>This is my beloved Son, hear ye him:</hi> Here is your <hi>Teacher.</hi> But ye that hate the <hi>Light,</hi> do not learn of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and will not have him to be your <hi>King,</hi> to reign over you; him, to whom all Power in Heaven and Earth is given, who bears his <hi>Government</hi> upon his <hi>Shoulders,</hi> who is now come to reign: who lighteth every Man, that cometh into the World; and who will give to every Man a <hi>Reward,</hi> according to his <hi>Works,</hi> whether they be <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil.</hi> So every Man, with the <hi>Light</hi> that comes from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> will ſee his <hi>Deeds,</hi> both he that <hi>hates</hi> it, and he that <hi>loves</hi> it.

            <p>We lay one Night at <hi>Farnham,</hi> where we had a little <hi>Meeting;</hi>

The <hi>Lord's Power</hi> chained them, that they had not power to do us any <hi>Miſchief:</hi> but when they went away, they left all their <hi>Fag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots</hi> and <hi>Beer,</hi> which they had called for into the <hi>Room,</hi> for us to <hi>pay for</hi> in the <hi>Morning.</hi> We ſhewed the <hi>Inn-keeper,</hi> what an <hi>

Cardiff.</note> and ſo paſſed through the Country to <hi>Cardiff;</hi> where a <hi>Juſtice</hi> of <hi>Peace</hi> ſent to me, deſiring, <hi>I would come up, with half a dozen of my Friends to his Houſe.</hi> So I took a <hi>Friend</hi> or <hi>two,</hi> and went up to him; and he and his <hi>Wife</hi> received us very civilly. The next Day we had a <hi>Meeting</hi> in <hi>Cardiff</hi> in the <hi>Town-Hall;</hi> and that <hi>Juſtice</hi> ſent about <hi>ſeventeen</hi> of his <hi>Family</hi> to the <hi>Meeting.</hi> There came ſome <hi>diſturbers;</hi> but the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Power</hi> was over them: and many were turned to the <hi>Lord</hi> there. There were ſome, that had <hi>run out</hi> with <hi>James Naylor,</hi> that did not come to <hi>Meetings;</hi> to whom I ſent Word, <hi>That the Day of their Viſitation was over:</hi> and they never proſpered after.</p>
            <p>We travelled from <hi>Cardiff</hi> through the Country, to <hi>Swanzey,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Swanzey.</note> where we had a bleſſed <hi>Meeting:</hi> and a <hi>Meeting</hi> was ſettled there in the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> In our way thither we paſſed over in a <hi>Paſſage-boat</hi> with the <hi>high-Sheriff</hi> of the <hi>County:</hi> and the next
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:51448:162"/> Day I went to have ſpoken with him; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1657"/> but he would not be ſpoken withal.</p>
            <p>From thence we went to another <hi>Meeting</hi> in the Country; where the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Preſence</hi> was much with us. And from thence we went to a <hi>Great Man's Houſe,</hi> who received us very lovingly; but the next Morning he would not be ſeen: <hi>One,</hi> that in the mean time came to him, had ſo <hi>eſtranged</hi> him, that we could not get to him to <hi>ſpeak</hi> with him again, he was ſo <hi>Changed;</hi> and yet over-night was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Loving.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We paſſed ſtill on through the Countries, having <hi>Meetings,</hi> and gathering People in the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to him their heavenly <hi>Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Brecknock.</note> till we came to <hi>Brecknock:</hi> where we ſet up our Horſes at an <hi>Inn.</hi> There went with me <hi>Thomas Holmes,</hi> and <hi>John ap John;</hi> who was moved of the Lord to <hi>ſpeak in the Streets.</hi> I walked out but a little into the <hi>Fields:</hi> and when I came in again, the <hi>Town</hi> was up in an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>proar.</hi> When I came into the <hi>Chamber</hi> in the <hi>Inn,</hi> it was full of <hi>People;</hi> and they were ſpeaking in <hi>Welch:</hi> I deſired them to ſpeak in <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and they did: and much diſcourſe we had. After a while they went away. But towards Night the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together in the <hi>Streets,</hi> with a <hi>multitude</hi> of <hi>People;</hi> and they bid them <hi>ſhout:</hi> and gathered up the Town: So that for about <hi>Two Hours</hi> together, there was ſuch a <hi>Noiſe,</hi> as the like we had not heard; and the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> ſet them on to <hi>ſhout again,</hi> when they had given over. We thought, it looked like the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>proar,</hi> which we read was amongſt <hi>Diana</hi>'s <hi>Handicrafts-Men:</hi> This <hi>Tumult</hi> continued, till it was <hi>within Night;</hi> and if the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Power</hi> had not limited, them, they ſeemed likely to have <hi>pulled down</hi> the <hi>Houſe,</hi> and <hi>us to pieces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After it was Night, the <hi>Woman</hi> of the <hi>Houſe</hi> would have had us go to <hi>Supper</hi> in another Room: but we diſcerning her <hi>Plot,</hi> refuſed. Then ſhe would have had <hi>half a dozen</hi> Men come into the <hi>Room</hi> to us, under pretence of diſcourſing with us: but we told her; That <hi>no Perſons ſhould come into our Room that Night, neither would we go to them.</hi> Then ſhe told us, we ſhould <hi>ſup in another Room:</hi> but we told her, we would have no <hi>Supper,</hi> if we had it not in our own <hi>Room.</hi> At length when ſhe ſaw, ſhe could not get us out; ſhe brought up our <hi>Supper</hi> in a great <hi>Rage.</hi> So <hi>She</hi> and <hi>They</hi> were croſſed in their <hi>Deſign:</hi> for they had an Intent to have done us <hi>Miſchief;</hi> but the Lord God prevented them. Next Morning I writ a <hi>Paper</hi> to the Town concerning their <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nchriſtian Carriages;</hi> ſhewing the <hi>Fruits</hi> of their <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Magiſtrates:</hi> and as I paſſed out of the Town, I ſpake to the <hi>People,</hi> and told them; They were a <hi>ſhame to Chriſtianity, and Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this Place we went to a great <hi>Meeting</hi> in a <hi>Steeple-houſe-yard;</hi> where was a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and <hi>Walter Jenkin,</hi> who had been a <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and another <hi>Juſtice:</hi> and a bleſſed, glorious <hi>Meeting</hi> we had. And there being many <hi>Profeſſors,</hi> I was moved of the <hi>Lord</hi> to open the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures</hi> to them, and to Anſwer the <hi>Objections,</hi> 
               <q>which they ſtuck at in their <hi>Profeſſion</hi> (for I knew them very well;) and to turn them to <hi>Christ,</hi> who had <hi>enlightned</hi> them: with which <hi>Light</hi> they might ſee their <hi>Sins</hi> and <hi>Treſpaſſes</hi> they had been <hi>dead</hi> in, and their <hi>Saviour,</hi>
                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:51448:162"/> him that came to <hi>Redeem</hi> them out of them,<note place="margin">1657.

               </q> A peaceable <hi>Meeting</hi> we had; and many were <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,</hi> and ſettled in the <hi>Truth</hi> that day. After the <hi>Meeting</hi> was over, I went with <hi>Walter Jenkin</hi> to the other <hi>Juſtice</hi>'s Houſe; and he ſaid unto me, <hi>You have this day given great ſatisfaction to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and anſwered all the Objections, that were in their Minds.</hi> For the People had the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> but they were not turned to the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which ſhould let them ſee that, which gave them forth, the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> which is the <hi>Key</hi> to <hi>open</hi> them.</p>
            <p>From hence we paſſed to <hi>Pontamile,</hi> to <hi>Richard Hamborow</hi>'s,<note place="margin">Pontamile</note> where was a great <hi>Meeting;</hi> to which there came another <hi>Juſtice</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> and ſeveral Great People: whoſe Underſtandings were opened by the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> and the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Christ;</hi> and they came to be turned to the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> from whence it came. A great <hi>Convincement</hi> there was; and a large <hi>Meeting</hi> is gathered in thoſe parts, and ſettled in the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this we returned back to <hi>England,</hi> and came to <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>England.</hi> Shrewſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</note> where we had a great <hi>Meeting:</hi> and viſited <hi>Friends</hi> all up and down the Countries in their <hi>Meetings,</hi> till we came to <hi>William Gandy</hi>'s in <hi>Cheſhire;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cheſhire.</note> where we had a <hi>Meeting</hi> of between <hi>two</hi> and <hi>three thouſand People</hi> (as it was thought:) and the everlaſting <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> was held forth, and received that day. A bleſſed <hi>Meeting</hi> it was; for <hi>Friends</hi> were ſettled by the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God</hi> upon Chriſt Jeſus, the <hi>Rock</hi> and <hi>Foundation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At this time there was a great <hi>Drought:</hi> And after this <hi>general Meeting</hi> was ended, there fell ſo <hi>great</hi> a <hi>Rain,</hi> that <hi>Friends</hi> ſaid; they thought we could not <hi>Travel,</hi> the <hi>Brooks</hi> and <hi>Waters</hi> would be ſo riſen. But I believed, the <hi>Rain</hi> had gone <hi>ſo far,</hi> as they had come that day to the <hi>Meeting.</hi> And the <hi>next</hi> day in the Afternoon, when we turned back into ſome parts of <hi>Wales</hi> again, the ways were <hi>duſty;</hi> and no <hi>Rain</hi> had fallen thereabouts.</p>
            <p>And when <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> ſet forth a <hi>Proclamation</hi> for a <hi>Faſt</hi> throughout the Nation, for <hi>Rain,</hi> when there was a very <hi>great Drought,</hi> it was obſerved, that as far as <hi>Truth</hi> had ſpread in the <hi>North,</hi> there were pleaſant <hi>Showers</hi> and <hi>Rain</hi> enough; when in the <hi>South,</hi> in many places, they were almoſt <hi>ſpoiled</hi> for <hi>want</hi> of <hi>Rain.</hi> At that time I was moved to write an <hi>Anſwer</hi> to the <hi>Protector's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation;</hi> wherein I told him: <q>If he had come to own <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Truth,</hi> he ſhould have had <hi>Rain:</hi> And that <hi>Drought</hi> was a <hi>Sign</hi> unto them of their <hi>Barrenneſs,</hi> and <hi>Want</hi> of the <hi>Water</hi> of <hi>Life.</hi>

                        </p>

               <note place="margin">Lemſter.</note>I went back from thence to <hi>Lemſter,</hi> where there was a great <hi>Meeting</hi> in a <hi>Cloſe;</hi> many <hi>hundreds</hi> of <hi>People</hi> being gathered together. There were a Matter of <hi>ſix Congregational Preachers</hi> and <hi>Prieſts</hi> amongſt the People; and <hi>Thomas Taylor,</hi> who had been a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> but was now become a <hi>Miniſter</hi> of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> was with me.

But after a while <hi>Thomas Taylor</hi> was moved to go to him, and ſpake to him; and he gave over: and then he, and the <hi>People</hi> he had drawn off, came up to us again; and the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Power</hi> went over them all. At laſt a <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> that was <hi>Convinced,</hi> ſaid; <hi>Where's Prieſt</hi> Tombs? <hi>how chance, he doth not come out?</hi> This <hi>Tombs</hi> was <hi>Prieſt</hi> of <hi>Lemſter.</hi> Hereupon ſome went, and told the <hi>Prieſt;</hi> and up comes he with the <hi>Bailiffs</hi> and other <hi>Officers</hi> of the <hi>Town:</hi> And when he was come, they ſet him upon a <hi>Stool</hi> over againſt me. Now I was ſpeaking of the heavenly, divine <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which he <hi>Enlightens every one, that cometh into the World</hi> withal; and turning them to it, <hi>to give them the Knowledge of the glory of God in the Face of Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> their Saviour. When Prieſt <hi>Tombs</hi> heard this, he cried out; <hi>That is a Natural Light, and a made Light.</hi> Then I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the <hi>People</hi> to take out their <hi>Bibles:</hi> and I asked the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> 
               <q>Whether he did Affirm, that that was a <hi>Created, natural, made Light,</hi> which <hi>John,</hi> a Man that was <hi>ſent</hi> from <hi>God,</hi> did bear witneſs to, and did ſpeak of, when he ſaid; <hi>In him</hi> (to wit, in the <hi>Word) was life, and that life was the Light of Men,</hi> Joh. 1.4. Doſt thou affirm and mean, ſaid I, that this <hi>Light</hi> here ſpoken of, was a <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, Natural, Made Light?</hi> And he ſaid, <hi>Yes.</hi> Then ſaid I, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have done with thee, I will make thee <hi>bend</hi> to the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> Then I ſhewed by the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> that the <hi>Natural, created, made Light</hi> is the outward <hi>Light</hi> in the outward <hi>Firmament,</hi> proceeding from the <hi>Sun, Moon</hi> and <hi>Stars:</hi> And doſt thou Affirm (ſaid I) that God ſent <hi>John</hi> to bear witneſs to the <hi>Light</hi> of the <hi>Sun, Moon</hi> and <hi>Stars?</hi> Then ſaid he, <hi>Did I ſay ſo?</hi> I replied, 'Didſt thou not not ſay, it was a <hi>Natural, Created, Made Light,</hi> that <hi>John</hi> bore witneſs unto? If thou doſt not like thy Words, take them again and mend them. Then he ſaid, <hi>That Light, which I ſpake of, was a
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:51448:165"/> natural, created Light.</hi> I told him,<note place="margin">1657. Lemſter.</note> He had not at all mended his Cauſe: for that <hi>Light,</hi> which I ſpake of, was the very ſame, that <hi>John</hi> was ſent of <hi>God</hi> to bear witneſs to; which was the <hi>Life</hi> in the <hi>Word,</hi> by which all the <hi>natural Lights,</hi> as <hi>Sun, Moon</hi> and <hi>Stars</hi> were made. <hi>In him</hi> (to wit, the <hi>Word) was Life, and that Life was the Light of Men.</hi>
               </q> So I directed the People to turn to the Place in their <hi>Bibles,</hi> and I recited to them the Words of <hi>John,</hi> how that <hi>In the Beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The ſame was in the beginning with God: All things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made, that was made.</hi> (So all <hi>natural, created Lights</hi> were made by <hi>Chriſt</hi> the <hi>Word.) In him was life, and the life was the light of Men: And that was the true light, which lighteth every Man, that cometh into the World.</hi> And Chriſt ſaith of himſelf (<hi>John</hi> 8.12.) <hi>I am the light of the World:</hi> And bids them, <hi>Believe in the light</hi> (John 12.36.) And God ſaid of him by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah (ch.</hi> 49.6.) <hi>I will alſo give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayeſt be my Salvation to the Ends of the Earth:</hi> So Chriſt in his <hi>Light</hi> is <hi>ſaving.</hi> And the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>The light, which ſhined in their Hearts, was to give them the light of the knowledge of the Glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> And that was their Treaſure in their earthen Veſſels. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6, 7.</p>
            <p>When I had thus opened the matter to the People, the <hi>Prieſt</hi> cried to the <hi>Magiſtrates; Take this man away, or elſe I ſhall not ſpeak any more.</hi> But, ſaid I, 'Prieſt <hi>Tombs,</hi> deceive not thy ſelf, thou art not in thy <hi>Pulpit</hi> now, nor in thy Old <hi>Maſs-houſe;</hi> but we are in the <hi>Fields.</hi> So he was ſhuffling to be gone: and <hi>Thomas Taylor</hi> ſtood up, and undertook to make out our <hi>Principle</hi> by <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Parable</hi> concerning the <hi>Sower,</hi> Matth. 13. Then ſaid the <hi>Prieſt, Let that Man ſpeak, and not the other.</hi> So he got up into a little <hi>Jangling</hi> for a while; till the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Power</hi> catched him again, and ſtopt and confounded him. Afterwards a <hi>Friend</hi> ſtood up and told him, <hi>How he had ſued him for Tithe-Eggs, and other Friends for other Tithes:</hi> for he was an <hi>Anabaptiſt Preacher,</hi> and yet had a <hi>Parſonage</hi> at <hi>Lemſter;</hi> and had ſeveral <hi>Journey-men</hi> under him. And he ſaid; <hi>He had a Wife, and he had a Concubine; and his Wife was the Baptized People, and his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine was the World.</hi> But the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Power</hi> came over him and them all, and the everlaſting <hi>Truth</hi> was declared that Day; and many were turned by it to the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> their <hi>Teacher</hi> and <hi>Way</hi> to <hi>God:</hi> And of great <hi>Service</hi> that <hi>Meeting</hi> was in thoſe Parts. The next day <hi>Thomas Taylor</hi> went to this <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and reaſoned with him; and came over him by the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Word.</hi>

            <p>From this place I travelled on in <hi>Wales,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tenby.</note> having ſeveral <hi>Meetings</hi> as I went, till I came to <hi>Tenby:</hi> where, as I rode up the <hi>Street,</hi> a <hi>Juſtice</hi> of <hi>Peace</hi> came out of his <hi>Houſe, and deſired me to alight, and ſtay at his Houſe:</hi> and I did ſo.

               </q> He ſaid; <hi>For ſtanding with his Hat on in the Church.</hi> I ſaid, <q>Had not the Prieſt <hi>two Caps</hi> on his Head, a <hi>black</hi> one, and a <hi>white</hi> one? and cut of the <hi>brims</hi> of the <hi>Hat,</hi> and then my <hi>Friend</hi> would have but one; and the <hi>brims</hi> of the <hi>Hat</hi> were but to defend him from <hi>Weather.

               </q> Then he asked me, <hi>Whether I owned Election and Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi> 
               <q>Yes, ſaid I, and thou art in the <hi>Reprobation.</hi>
               </q> At that he was in a <hi>Rage,</hi> and ſaid; <hi>He would ſend me to Priſon, till I proved it:</hi> But I told him, <q>I would prove that quickly, if he would confeſs <hi>Truth.</hi> Then I asked him, Whether <hi>Wrath, Fury</hi> and <hi>Rage,</hi> and <hi>Perſecution</hi> were not Marks of <hi>Reprobation?</hi> for he that was <hi>born</hi> of the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> perſecuted him that was <hi>born</hi> of the <hi>Spirit;</hi> but <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Diſciples</hi> never <hi>perſecuted,</hi> nor <hi>impriſoned</hi> any.</q> Then he fairly Confeſt, <hi>That he had too much Wrath, Haſte and Paſſion in him:</hi> And I told him, <q>
                  <hi>Eſau</hi> was up in him, the <hi>firſt-Birth;</hi> not <hi>Jacob,</hi> the <hi>ſecond-Birth.</hi>
               </q> The <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Power</hi> ſo reached the Man, and came over him, that he confeſs'd to <hi>Truth;</hi> and the other <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice</hi> came, and ſhook me kindly by the Hand.</p>
            <p>As I was paſſing away, I was moved to ſpeak to the <hi>Governour</hi> again; and he <hi>Invited me to Dinner with him;</hi> and ſet my <hi>Friend</hi> at <hi>Liberty.</hi> I went back to the other <hi>Juſtice</hi>'s Houſe: And after ſome time the <hi>Mayor</hi> and his <hi>Wife,</hi> and the <hi>Juſtice</hi> and his <hi>Wife,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other <hi>Friends</hi> of the <hi>Town</hi> went about <hi>half a Mile</hi> out of <hi>Town</hi> with us, to the <hi>Water-ſide,</hi> when we went away; and there, when we parted from them, I was moved of the <hi>Lord</hi> to <q>kneel down with them, and <hi>pray</hi> to the <hi>Lord</hi> to preſerve them.</q> So after I had recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended them to the <hi>Lord Jeſus Christ,</hi> their <hi>Saviour</hi> and free <hi>Teacher,</hi> we paſſed away in the <hi>Lord's Power;</hi> and the <hi>Lord</hi> had the Glory: And there is a <hi>Meeting</hi> continues in that <hi>Town</hi> to this Day.</p>

               </q> But they would not anſwer me a Word; only looked out at the <hi>Windows</hi> upon me. <q>So I ſhewed them, how <hi>unchriſtian</hi> their <hi>Carriage</hi> was to <hi>Strangers</hi> and <hi>Travellers,</hi> and manifeſted the <hi>Fruits</hi> of their <hi>Teachers;</hi> and I declared the <hi>Truth</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and warned them of the <hi>Day</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> that was coming upon all the <hi>Evil-Doers:</hi>
               </q> and the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> came over them, that they looked <hi>aſhamed;</hi> but not a <hi>Word</hi> could I get from them in <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</hi> So when I had warned them to Repent, and <hi>Turn</hi> to the <hi>Lord,</hi> we paſſed away: And at Night came to a little <hi>Inn,</hi> very <hi>poor,</hi> but very <hi>cheap;</hi> for our own <hi>Proviſion,</hi> and our <hi>two Horſes</hi> coſt but <hi>Eight Pence:</hi> But the Horſes would not eat their <hi>Oats.</hi> We declared the <hi>Truth</hi> to the <hi>People</hi> of the Place, and ſounded the <hi>Day</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> through the <hi>Countries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Travelling from thence, we came to a great <hi>Town,</hi> and went to an <hi>Inn.</hi> And <hi>Edward Edwards</hi> went into the <hi>Market,</hi> and declared the <hi>Truth</hi> amongſt the <hi>People;</hi> and the <hi>People</hi> followed him down to the <hi>Inn,</hi> and filled the <hi>Inn-yard,</hi> and were exceeding <hi>rude:</hi> Yet a good <hi>Service</hi> he and we had for the <hi>Lord</hi> amongſt them. For the <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and the <hi>Power</hi> of it tormented their <hi>chaffy Spirits,</hi> and came over them, ſo that ſome were reached and <hi>Convinced;</hi> and the
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:51448:167"/> 
               <hi>Lord's Power</hi> came over all: and the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> were bound, they had no <hi>Power</hi> to <hi>meddle</hi> with us.</p>
            <p>After this we paſſed away, and came to another great <hi>Town</hi> on a <hi>Market day;</hi> and <hi>John ap John</hi> declared the Everlaſting <hi>Truth</hi> through the <hi>Streets,</hi> and proclaimed the <hi>Day</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> amongſt them. In the Evening many People gathered about the <hi>Inn;</hi> and ſome of them being <hi>drunk,</hi> they would fain have had us forth into the <hi>Street</hi> again: but we ſeeing their <hi>Deſign,</hi> I told them; <q>If there were any, that <hi>feared God,</hi> and deſired to hear <hi>Truth,</hi> they might come into our <hi>Inn:</hi> or elſe we might have a <hi>Meeting</hi> with them next <hi>Morning.</hi>
               </q> So ſome <hi>Service</hi> for the <hi>Lord</hi> we had amongſt them, both over <hi>Night</hi> and in the <hi>Morning:</hi> And though the <hi>People</hi> was <hi>hard</hi> to receive the <hi>Truth,</hi> yet the <hi>Seed</hi> was <hi>ſown;</hi> and thereabouts the <hi>Lord</hi> hath a <hi>People</hi> gathered to himſelf. In that <hi>Inn</hi> alſo I turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but my Back to the <hi>Man,</hi> that was giving <hi>Oats</hi> to my <hi>Horſe;</hi> and I looked back again, and he was filling his <hi>Pockets</hi> with the <hi>Provender,</hi> that was given to my <hi>Horſe.</hi> A <hi>wicked, theeviſh People,</hi> to rob the <hi>poor, dumb Creature</hi> of his <hi>Food!</hi> I had rather they had robbed me.</p>
            <p>Leaving this <hi>Town,</hi> and travelling on, there was a <hi>Great Man</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took us on the <hi>Way;</hi> and he purpoſed (as he told us afterward) to have taken us up at the next <hi>Town</hi> for <hi>High-way-men.</hi> But before we came to the <hi>Town,</hi> I was moved of the <hi>Lord</hi> to ſpeak to him: And what I ſpake, reached to the <hi>Witneſs</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in the <hi>Man;</hi> and he was ſo affected therewith, that he had us to his <hi>Houſe,</hi> and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained us very <hi>civilly.</hi> And he and his <hi>Wife</hi> deſired us to give them ſome <hi>Scriptures,</hi> both for <hi>proof</hi> of our <hi>Principles,</hi> and againſt the <hi>Prieſts.</hi> We were glad of the <hi>Service,</hi> and furniſhed him with <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures</hi> enough: And he writ them down, and was <hi>Convinced</hi> of the <hi>Truth,</hi> both by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in his own Heart, and by the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,</hi> which were a <hi>Confirmation</hi> to him. Afterwards he ſet us on in our Journey: And as we travelled, we came to an <hi>Hill,</hi> which the People of the <hi>Country</hi> ſay, is <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three Miles high;</hi> from the <hi>Side</hi> of this <hi>Hill</hi> I could ſee a great Way. And I was moved to ſet my Face ſeveral ways, and to <hi>ſound</hi> the <hi>Day</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> there: And I told <hi>John ap John</hi> (a faithful <hi>Welch</hi> Miniſter) in what <hi>Places</hi> God would raiſe up a <hi>People</hi> to himſelf, to ſit under his own <hi>Teaching.</hi> Thoſe <hi>Places</hi> he took notice of; and ſince there hath a <hi>great People</hi> ariſen in thoſe <hi>Places.</hi> The like I have been moved to do in many other <hi>Places</hi> and <hi>Countries,</hi> which have been <hi>rude Places;</hi> and yet I have been moved to declare, the <hi>Lord</hi> had a <hi>Seed</hi> in thoſe <hi>Places:</hi> and afterwards there hath been a <hi>brave People</hi> raiſed up in the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and gathered in the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Jeſus;</hi> where they have <hi>Salvation</hi> and <hi>free Teaching.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Dalgelthly</note>From this <hi>Hill</hi> we came down to a <hi>Place</hi> called <hi>Dalgelthly:</hi> and we went to an <hi>Inn;</hi> and <hi>John ap John</hi> declared through the <hi>Streets:</hi> and the <hi>Town's People</hi> roſe, and gathered about him. And there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>two Independent-Prieſts</hi> in the <hi>Town,</hi> they both came out, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed with him both together. I went up to them: and finding them ſpeaking in <hi>Welch,</hi> I asked them, <q>What was the <hi>Subject</hi> they ſpake upon, and why they were not more <hi>moderate,</hi> and ſpake one
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:51448:167"/> by one? For the <hi>things</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> I told them, were <hi>weighty,</hi> and they ſhould ſpeak of them with <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Reverence.</hi> Then I deſired them to ſpeak in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that I might diſcourſe with them:</q> and they did ſo. Now they affirmed, <hi>That the</hi> Light, <hi>which</hi> John <hi>came to bear witneſs of, was a created, natural, made</hi> Light. But I took the <hi>Bible,</hi> and ſhewed them (as I had done to others before) <q>That the <hi>Natural Lights,</hi> which were made and created, were the <hi>Sun, Moon</hi> and <hi>Stars:</hi> but this <hi>Light,</hi> which <hi>John</hi> bare witneſs to, and which he called the <hi>True Light,</hi> that <hi>lighteth every Man, that cometh into the World,</hi> is the <hi>Life</hi> in <hi>Chriſt</hi> the <hi>Word,</hi> by which all things were made and created. The ſame, that is called the <hi>Life</hi> in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is called the <hi>Light</hi> in <hi>Man:</hi> and this is an <hi>heavenly, divine Light,</hi> which lets Men ſee their <hi>evil Words</hi> and <hi>Deeds,</hi> and ſhews them all their <hi>Sins;</hi> and (if they would attend unto it) would bring them to <hi>Chriſt</hi> (from whom it comes,) that they might know him to <hi>ſave</hi> them from their <hi>Sin,</hi> and to blot it out. This <hi>Light,</hi> I told them, ſhined in the <hi>Darkneſs</hi> in their Hearts, and the <hi>Darkneſs</hi> in them could not comprehend it: but in thoſe Hearts, where <hi>God</hi> had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it to ſhine out of <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> it gave unto ſuch the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of the <hi>glory</hi> of <hi>God, in the face of Christ Jeſus,</hi> their Saviour. Then I opened the <hi>Scriptures</hi> largely to them, and turned them to the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in their Hearts; which would reveal the <hi>Myſteries</hi> in the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to them, and would lead them into all the <hi>Truth</hi> thereof, as they became <hi>ſubject</hi> thereunto. I directed them to that, which would give every one of them the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who died for them; that he might be their <hi>Way</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> and might make <hi>Peace</hi> betwixt <hi>God</hi> and them.</q> The <hi>People</hi> were <hi>attentive,</hi> and I ſpake to <hi>John ap John</hi> to ſtand up, and ſpeak it in <hi>Welch</hi> to them; which he did: and they generally <hi>received</hi> it, and with <hi>Hands lifted up,</hi> bleſſed and praiſed God. The <hi>Prieſt's Mouths</hi> were <hi>ſtopt,</hi> ſo that they were quiet all the while: for I had brought them to be <hi>ſober</hi> at the firſt, by telling them, <q>
                  <hi>That</hi> when they ſpeak of the <hi>things</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they ſhould ſpeak with <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Reverence.</hi>
               </q> Thus the <hi>Meeting</hi> brake up in peace in the <hi>Street:</hi> and many of the People accompanied us to our <hi>Inn,</hi> and <hi>rejoiced</hi> in the <hi>Truth,</hi> that had been declared unto them; that they were turned to the <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> in themſelves, by which they might ſee their <hi>Sin,</hi> and know <hi>Salvation</hi> from it. And when we went out of the <hi>Town,</hi> the People were ſo affected, that they <hi>lifted up</hi> their <hi>Hands,</hi> and bleſt the <hi>Lord</hi> for our <hi>Coming.</hi> A <hi>pretious Seed</hi> the Lord hath there-aways; and a <hi>great People</hi> in thoſe Parts is ſince gathered to the <hi>Lord Jeſus Christ,</hi> to ſit down under his <hi>free Teaching;</hi> and have <hi>ſuffered</hi> much for him.</p>
            <p>From this place we paſſed to a <hi>City,</hi> like a <hi>Caſtle:</hi> Where when we had ſet up our Horſes at an <hi>Inn,</hi> and refreſhed our ſelves, <hi>John ap John</hi> went forth, and <hi>ſpake</hi> through the <hi>Streets;</hi> which were ſo <hi>ſtrait</hi> and <hi>ſhort,</hi> that one might ſtand in the <hi>Midſt</hi> of the <hi>Town,</hi> and ſee <hi>both</hi> the <hi>Gates.</hi> I followed <hi>John ap John,</hi> and a multitude of People were ſoon gathered about him; amongſt whom a very <hi>dark Prieſt</hi> began to <hi>babble:</hi> but his <hi>Mouth</hi> was ſoon <hi>ſtopped.</hi> So when <hi>John</hi> had cleared himſelf, I declared the <hi>word</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> amongſt the

               <hi>People;</hi> 
               <q>directing them to the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in their Hearts, that by it they might ſee all their own <hi>Ways, Religions</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> and might come off from them all, to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the true and living <hi>Way,</hi> and the <hi>Free Teacher.</hi>
               </q> Some of the <hi>People</hi> were <hi>rude,</hi> but the greater part were <hi>civil;</hi> and told us, <hi>They had heard, how we had been perſecuted, and abuſed in many places, but they would not do ſo to us there.</hi> I commended their <hi>Moderation</hi> and <hi>Sobriety,</hi> 
               <q>and warned them of the <hi>Day</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> that was coming upon all <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Wickedneſs;</hi> teſtifying unto them, that <hi>Christ</hi> was now come to <hi>Teach</hi> his <hi>People</hi> himſelf, by his <hi>Spirit</hi> and by his <hi>Power.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Beaumor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</note>From hence we went to <hi>Beaumorris;</hi> a <hi>Town,</hi> wherein <hi>John ap John</hi> had formerly been <hi>Preacher</hi> to a <hi>Congregation.</hi> After we had put up our Horſes at an <hi>Inn, John</hi> went forth, and <hi>ſpake</hi> through the <hi>Street:</hi> and there being a <hi>Garriſon</hi> in the <hi>Town,</hi> they took him, and put him into <hi>Priſon.</hi> The <hi>Inn-keeper</hi>'s <hi>Wife</hi> came, and told me, <hi>That the Governour and Magiſtrates were ſending for me, to ſend me to Priſon alſo:</hi> I told her, <q>They had done more, than they could anſwer already; and had acted contrary to <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> in <hi>Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> him for <hi>Reproving Sin</hi> in their <hi>Streets</hi> and <hi>Gates,</hi> and for <hi>declaring</hi> the <hi>Truth.</hi>
               </q> Soon after came other <hi>friendly People,</hi> and told me; <hi>If I went out into the Street, they would Impriſon me alſo: and therefore they deſired me to keep within the Inn.</hi> Upon this I was moved to go, and <hi>walk</hi> up and down in the <hi>Streets;</hi> and told the <hi>People,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Next Day, being <hi>Market-day,</hi> we were to croſs over a great <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi> and not far from the <hi>place,</hi> where we were to take <hi>Boat,</hi> many of the <hi>Market-People</hi> drew to us; amongſt whom we had good <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi> for the <hi>Lord,</hi>

               </q> So after the <hi>Lord's Truth</hi> had been declared to them in the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> the <hi>free Teacher</hi> ſet over all the <hi>Hireling-Teachers;</hi> I bid <hi>John ap John</hi> get his <hi>Horſe</hi> into the <hi>Boat,</hi> which was then ready.

            <p>On the <hi>Firſt-day</hi> we had a great <hi>Meeting,</hi> and ſeveral <hi>Profeſſors</hi> came to it.

            <p>Theſe things ſoon came to the <hi>Prieſts Ears:</hi> for the <hi>People,</hi> that ſate under their <hi>dark Teachings,</hi> began to ſee <hi>Light,</hi> and to come into the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Light.</hi> So the <hi>Noiſe</hi> was ſpread over <hi>Scotland,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Prieſts, That I was come thither;</hi> and a <hi>great Cry</hi> was among them, that all would be <hi>ſpoiled:</hi> for they ſaid, <hi>I had ſpoiled all the honeſt Men and Women in</hi> England <hi>already</hi> (ſo, upon their own account, the <hi>worſt</hi> were <hi>left</hi> to them.) Upon this they gathered great <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> of <hi>Prieſts</hi> together, and drew up a <hi>Company Articles</hi> of <hi>Curſes</hi> to be read in their ſeveral <hi>Steeple-houſes;</hi> and that all the <hi>People</hi> ſhould ſay, <hi>Amen</hi> to them. Some few of theſe I will here ſet down; the reſt may be read in the <hi>Book</hi> before-mentioned of <hi>The Scotch Prieſts Principles.</hi>

            <pb n="271" facs="tcp:51448:174"/>
            <p>In this <hi>laſt</hi> they make the People <hi>Curſe themſelves:</hi> for on the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day</hi> (which is the <hi>Seventh-day</hi> of the <hi>Week,</hi> which the <hi>Jews</hi> kept by the <hi>Command</hi> of <hi>God</hi> to them) they kept <hi>Markets</hi> and <hi>Fairs;</hi> and ſo brought the <hi>Curſe</hi> of <hi>God</hi> upon their own <hi>Heads.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as to the <hi>firſt,</hi> concerning the <hi>Light, Chriſt</hi> ſaith; <hi>Believe in the Light, that ye may become Children of the Light:</hi> and <hi>he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth, ſhall be ſaved; he that believeth, ſhall have everlaſting Life: He that believeth, paſſes from Death to Life, and is grafted into Chriſt. And ye do well,</hi> ſaid the Apoſtle, <hi>that ye take heed unto the Light, that ſhines in the dark place, until the day dawn, and the Day-ſtar ariſe in your Hearts.</hi> So the <hi>Light</hi> is ſufficient to lead unto the <hi>Day-ſtar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as concerning <hi>Faith,</hi> it is the <hi>gift</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> and every <hi>gift</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is <hi>pure.</hi> The <hi>faith,</hi> which <hi>Christ</hi> is the <hi>Author</hi> of, is precious, divine and <hi>without Sin:</hi> And this is the <hi>faith,</hi> which gives <hi>Victory</hi> over <hi>Sin,</hi> and Acceſs to God; in which <hi>faith</hi> they pleaſe God.

            <p>There were a Company of <hi>Scots</hi> near <hi>Badcow,</hi>

            <p>I mentioned before, that many of the <hi>Scotch Prieſts,</hi> being great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſturbed at the <hi>Spreading</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Loſs</hi> of their <hi>Hearers</hi> thereby; were gone up to <hi>Edenborough,</hi> to <hi>Petition</hi> the <hi>Council</hi> againſt me.

            <p>After I had ſpent ſome time among <hi>Friends</hi> at <hi>Edenborough,</hi> and thereabouts,<note place="margin">Heads.</note> I paſſed from thence to <hi>Heads</hi> again, where <hi>Friends</hi> had been in great <hi>Sufferings:</hi> for the <hi>Presbyterian Prieſts</hi> had <hi>Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated</hi> them, and given Charge, <hi>That none ſhould Buy or Sell with them, nor Eat nor Drink with them.</hi> So they could neither <hi>Sell</hi> their <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,</hi> nor <hi>Buy</hi> what they <hi>wanted;</hi> which made it go very <hi>hard</hi> with ſome of them: for if they had bought <hi>Bread</hi> or other <hi>Victuals</hi> of any of their <hi>Neighbours,</hi> the <hi>Prieſts</hi> threatned them ſo with <hi>Curſes,</hi> that they would run, and <hi>fetch</hi> it from them <hi>again.</hi> But Colonel <hi>Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> being a <hi>Juſtice</hi> of <hi>Peace</hi> in that Country, put a <hi>ſtop</hi> to the <hi>Prieſts</hi> Proceedings.

            <p>After I had viſited <hi>Friends</hi> at <hi>Heads</hi> and there-aways, and had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged them in the <hi>Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Glaſcow.</note> I went to <hi>Glaſcow,</hi> where a <hi>Meeting</hi> was appointed; but not <hi>One</hi> of the <hi>Town</hi> came to it. As I went into the <hi>City,</hi> the <hi>Guard</hi> at the <hi>Gates</hi> had me up before the <hi>Governour,</hi> who was a <hi>moderate Man;</hi> and a gread deal of <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> I had with him: but he was too <hi>light</hi> to receive the <hi>Truth;</hi> yet he ſet me at <hi>Liberty,</hi> and ſo I paſſed to the <hi>Meeting.</hi> But ſeeing, <hi>none</hi> of the <hi>Town</hi>'s <hi>People</hi> came to the <hi>Meeting,</hi> we <hi>declared Truth through the Town,</hi> and ſo paſſed away; and viſited <hi>Friends</hi> in their <hi>Meetings</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts:<note place="margin">Badcow.</note> and then returned towards <hi>Badcow.</hi> Several <hi>Friends</hi> went, and declared <hi>Truth</hi> in their <hi>Steeple-houſes;</hi> and the <hi>Lod</hi>'s <hi>Power</hi> was with them. And one time, as I was going with <hi>William Osburn</hi> to his <hi>Houſe,</hi> there lay a Company of <hi>rude Fellows</hi> by the <hi>Way-ſide,</hi> who had <hi>hid</hi> themſelves under the <hi>Hedges</hi> and in <hi>Buſhes;</hi> and I <hi>ſpying</hi> them, asked him, What they were? <hi>Oh,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>they are Thieves.</hi> Now <hi>Robert Widders</hi> being moved to go to ſpeak to a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> was left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, intending to come after. So I ſaid to <hi>William Osburn,</hi> 
               <q>I will ſtay here in this <hi>Valley;</hi> and do thou go look after <hi>Robert Widders:</hi>
               </q> But he was unwilling to go, being afraid to leave me there <hi>alone,</hi> becauſe of thoſe <hi>Fellows;</hi> till I told him, 'I feared them not. Then I called to them, asking them, What they lay <hi>lurking</hi> there for? and I bid them, Come up to me: but they were <hi>loth</hi> to <hi>come up.</hi> I charged them to <hi>come up</hi> to me, or elſe it might be <hi>worſe</hi> with them: Then they came <hi>trembling</hi> to me; for the <hi>Dread</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> had <hi>ſtruck</hi> them. I admoniſhed them to be <hi>honeſt;</hi> and directed them to the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in their Hearts, that by it they might ſee, what an <hi>Evil</hi> it was to follow after <hi>Theft</hi> and <hi>Robbery:</hi> and the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> came over them. So I ſtayed there, till <hi>William Osburn</hi> and <hi>Robert Widders</hi> came up; and then we paſſed on toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But it is likely, that if we <hi>two</hi> had gone away before, they would have <hi>robbed Robert Widders,</hi> when he had come after <hi>alone;</hi> there being <hi>three</hi> or <hi>four</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>We went to <hi>William Osburn</hi>'s Houſe, where we had a good Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to declare the <hi>Truth</hi> to ſeveral <hi>People,</hi> that came in there. And then we went among the <hi>Highlanders;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Highlands</note> who were ſo <hi>Devilliſh,</hi>
               <pb n="277" facs="tcp:51448:177"/> they had like to have <hi>ſpoiled</hi> us and our <hi>Horſes:</hi> for they run at us with <hi>Pitch-forks;</hi> but through the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Goodneſs</hi> we eſcaped them, being preſerved by his <hi>Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From thence we paſſed to <hi>Starling,</hi> where the <hi>Soldiers</hi> took us up,<note place="margin">Starling</note> and had us to the <hi>Main-guard;</hi> and after a few Words with their <hi>Officers,</hi> the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> coming over them, we were ſet at <hi>Liberty:</hi> But no <hi>Meeting</hi> could we get amongſt them in the <hi>Town,</hi> they were ſo cloſed up in <hi>Darkneſs. Next Morning</hi> there came a <hi>Man</hi> with an <hi>Horſe,</hi> that was to run a <hi>Race;</hi> and moſt of the <hi>Town's People,</hi> and the <hi>Officers</hi> went to ſee it. As they came back from the <hi>Race,</hi> I had a brave Opportunity, to declare the <hi>Day</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and his <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> amongſt them: Some Confeſſed to it, and ſome Oppoſed: but the <hi>Lord's Truth</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> came over them all.</p>
            <p>Leaving <hi>Starling,</hi> we travelled through the <hi>Country,</hi> till we came to <hi>Burnt-Iſland,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Burnt-Iſland.</note> where I had <hi>two Meetings</hi> at one Captain <hi>Pool</hi>'s Houſe; one in the <hi>Morning,</hi> and the other in the <hi>Afternoon.</hi> Whilſt they went to <hi>Dinner,</hi> I walked to the <hi>Sea-ſide,</hi> not having freedom to eat with them. Both he and his Wife were <hi>Convinced,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came good <hi>Friends</hi> afterward; and ſeveral <hi>Officers</hi> of the <hi>Army</hi> came in, and received the <hi>Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We paſſed from thence through ſeveral other <hi>Places</hi> in the <hi>Country,</hi> till we came to <hi>Johnſton</hi>'s; where were ſeveral <hi>Baptiſts,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Johnſtons</note> that were very bitter, and came in a <hi>Rage</hi> to <hi>diſpute</hi> with us: <hi>Vain Janglers</hi> and <hi>Diſputers</hi> indeed they were. And when they could not <hi>prevail</hi> by <hi>diſputing,</hi> they went, and <hi>informed</hi> the <hi>Governour</hi> againſt us; and next Morning they raiſed a whole <hi>Company</hi> of <hi>foot,</hi> and <hi>baniſhed</hi> me, and <hi>Alexander Parker,</hi> and <hi>James Lancaſter</hi> and <hi>Robert Widders</hi> out of the <hi>Town.</hi> As they guarded us through the Town, <hi>James Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter</hi> was moved to <hi>Sing</hi> with a <hi>Melodious Sound</hi> in the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> and I was moved to proclaim the <hi>Day</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and preach the Everlaſting <hi>Goſpel</hi> to the <hi>People.</hi> For the <hi>People</hi> generally came forth, ſo that the <hi>Streets</hi> were <hi>filled</hi> with them: and the <hi>Souldiers</hi> were ſo <hi>aſhamed,</hi> that they ſaid, <hi>They had rather have gone to</hi> Jamaica, <hi>than have guarded us ſo.</hi> But we were put into a <hi>Boat,</hi> with our <hi>Horſes;</hi> and carried over the <hi>Water,</hi> and there left. And the <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> who were the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of our being thus put out of this <hi>Town,</hi> were them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, not long after, <hi>turned out</hi> of the <hi>Army;</hi> and he that was then <hi>Governour,</hi> was <hi>turned out</hi> alſo, when the <hi>King</hi> came in.</p>
            <p>Being thus thruſt out of <hi>Johnſtons,</hi> we went to another <hi>Market-Town,</hi> where <hi>Edward Billing</hi> and many <hi>Souldiers</hi> quartered. We went to an <hi>Inn,</hi> and deſired to have a <hi>Meeting</hi> in the <hi>Town,</hi> that we might preach the Everlaſting <hi>Goſpel</hi> amongſt them. The <hi>Officers</hi> and <hi>Souldiers</hi> ſaid, <hi>We ſhould have it in the Town-hall;</hi> but the <hi>Scotch Magiſtrates</hi> in <hi>ſpight</hi> appointed a <hi>Meeting</hi> there that Day, for the <hi>Buſineſs</hi> of the <hi>Town.</hi> Which when the <hi>Officers</hi> of the <hi>Souldiery</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, and perceived, that it was done in <hi>Malice,</hi> they would have had us to have gone into the <hi>Town-hall</hi> nevertheleſs. But we told them, <hi>No, by no means;</hi> for then the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> might inform the <hi>Governour</hi> againſt them, and ſay, <hi>They took the</hi> Town-hall <hi>from them by force, when they were to do their Town-buſineſs therein.</hi> But we told them, 'We would go to the <hi>Market-place:</hi> They ſaid, <hi>It
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:51448:178"/> was Market-day;</hi> We replied, 'It was ſo much the better: for we would have all <hi>People</hi> to hear the <hi>Truth,</hi> and know our <hi>Principles.</hi> So <hi>Alexander Parker</hi> went up, and ſtood upon the <hi>Market-croſs,</hi> with a <hi>Bible</hi> in his Hand, and declared the <hi>Truth</hi> amongſt the <hi>Souldiers</hi> and <hi>Market-people;</hi> but the <hi>Scots,</hi> being a <hi>dark, carnal People,</hi> gave little heed, nor hardly took notice, what was ſaid. After a while I was moved of the <hi>Lord God</hi> to ſtand up at the <hi>Croſs,</hi> and to declare with a loud Voice the Everlaſting <hi>Truth,</hi> and the <hi>Day</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> that was coming upon all <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Wickedneſs.</hi> Whereupon the People came running out of the <hi>Town-hall;</hi> and they gathered ſo together, that at laſt we had a <hi>large Meeting:</hi> for they ſate in the <hi>Court</hi> but only for a <hi>Colour,</hi> to hinder us from having the <hi>Hall</hi> to <hi>Meet</hi> in. When the <hi>People</hi> were come away, the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> followed them; and ſome walked by, but ſome ſtaid and heard: and the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> came over all, and kept all quiet. And the <hi>People</hi> were <q>Turned to the <hi>Lord Jeſus Christ,</hi> who <hi>died</hi> for them, and had <hi>enlightned</hi> them; that with his <hi>Light</hi> they might all ſee their <hi>evil Deeds,</hi> and be <hi>ſaved</hi> from their <hi>Sins</hi> by him, and might come to know him to be their <hi>Teacher.</hi> But if they would not receive <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and own him, it was told them, that this <hi>Light,</hi> which came from him, would be their <hi>Condemnation.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Several of them were made <hi>loving</hi> to us, eſpecially of the <hi>Engliſh People,</hi> and ſome came afterwards to be <hi>Convinced.</hi> But there was a <hi>Souldier,</hi> that was very <hi>envious</hi> againſt us, and <hi>hated</hi> both us and the <hi>Truth,</hi> and ſpake <hi>Evil</hi> of the <hi>Truth,</hi> and very deſpitefully againſt the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> which we bore Teſtimony to; and mighty <hi>Zealous</hi> he was for the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and their <hi>Hearers.</hi> As this <hi>Man</hi> was hearing the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> holding his <hi>Hat</hi> before his <hi>Face,</hi> while the <hi>Prieſt prayed;</hi>
               <note place="margin">☞</note> one of the <hi>Prieſt's Hearers ſtabbed</hi> him to <hi>Death:</hi> So he, who had rejected the <hi>Teachings</hi> of the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>cried down the Servants</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> was <hi>murdered</hi> amongſt them, whom he had <hi>ſo cried up,</hi> and by <hi>one</hi> of them.</p>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough.</note>So I went from <hi>Leith</hi> up to <hi>Edenborough</hi> again, where they ſaid, the <hi>Warrants</hi> from the <hi>Council</hi> were out againſt me; and I went to the <hi>Inn,</hi> where I had lodged before: and no Man offered to meddle with me. After I had viſited the <hi>Friends</hi> in the <hi>City,</hi> I deſired thoſe <hi>Friends,</hi> that travelled with me, to get ready their <hi>Horſes</hi> in the <hi>Morning;</hi> and we rode out of <hi>Town</hi> together. There were with me at that time <hi>Thomas Rawlinſon, Alexander Parker</hi> and <hi>Robert Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi> When we were come out of <hi>Town,</hi> they asked me, <hi>Whether I would go?</hi> I told them, <q>It was upon me from the <hi>Lord,</hi> to go back again to <hi>Johnſton</hi> (the <hi>Town,</hi>

               <hi>Alexander Parker</hi> ſaid, <hi>he would go along with me:</hi> and I wiſht the other <hi>Two</hi> to ſtay at a <hi>Town,</hi> about <hi>three Miles</hi> from <hi>Edenborough,</hi> till we returned. Then <hi>Alexander Parker</hi> and I got over the <hi>Water,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Johnſtons.</note> which was about <hi>three Miles</hi> over; and rid on through the <hi>Country:</hi> but in the <hi>Afternoon,</hi> his <hi>Horſe</hi> being <hi>weak,</hi> and not able to hold up with mine, I put on, and got into <hi>Johnſton's,</hi> juſt as they were draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the <hi>Bridges;</hi> the <hi>Officers</hi> and <hi>Souldiers</hi> never queſtioning me. So I rid up the Street to Capt. <hi>Davenport</hi>'s Houſe, from which <hi>Houſe</hi> we had been <hi>baniſhed</hi> before. There were many <hi>Officers</hi> with him: and when I came amongſt them, they <hi>lifted up</hi> their <hi>Hands,</hi> admiring, that I ſhould come again; but I told them, <q>The <hi>Lord God</hi> had ſent me amongſt them again.</q> So they went their <hi>Way:</hi> And the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> ſent me a <hi>Letter,</hi> by way of <hi>Challenge,</hi> That <hi>they would diſcourſe with me the next day:</hi> I ſent them Word, <q>I would <hi>Meet</hi> them at ſuch an <hi>Houſe,</hi> about <hi>half</hi> a <hi>Mile</hi> out of the <hi>Town,</hi> at ſuch an <hi>Hour.</hi>
               </q> For I conſidered, if I ſhould ſtay in <hi>Town</hi> to <hi>diſcourſe</hi> with them they might, under pretence of <hi>diſcourſing</hi> with me, have <hi>raiſed Men, to put me out of the Town again,</hi> as they had done before. At the <hi>Time</hi> appointed I went to the <hi>Place</hi> appointed, Capt. <hi>Davenport</hi> and his <hi>Son</hi> accompanying me; and there I ſtay'd ſome <hi>Hours,</hi> but never a <hi>one</hi> of them came. But while I ſtay'd there <hi>waiting</hi> for them, I ſpied <hi>Alexander Parker</hi> coming; who not being able to reach the <hi>Town,</hi> had lain out the <hi>Night</hi> before: and when I ſaw him, I was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding <hi>glad,</hi> that we were met again.</p>
            <p>This Captain <hi>Davenport</hi> was then loving to <hi>Friends;</hi> but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards coming more into the <hi>Obedience</hi> to <hi>Truth,</hi> he was turned out of his <hi>Place,</hi> for <hi>not putting off his Hat,</hi> and for ſaying <hi>Thou</hi> and <hi>Thee</hi> to them.</p>
            <p>Now when we had waited, beyond reaſonable Ground to <hi>expect</hi> any of their <hi>Coming,</hi> we departed: And <hi>Alexander Parker</hi> being moved to go again to the <hi>Town,</hi> where we had the <hi>Meeting</hi> at the <hi>Market-Croſs;</hi> I paſſed alone through the Country to Lieutenant <hi>Foſter</hi>'s Quarters, where there were ſeveral <hi>Officers,</hi> that were <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced.</hi> From thence I went up to the <hi>Town,</hi> where I had left the other <hi>two Friends;</hi> and they and I went back to <hi>Edenborough</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>When we were come to the <hi>City,</hi> I bid <hi>Robert Widders</hi> follow me; and in the <hi>Dread</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> we came up to the <hi>two first Sentries:</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> came ſo over them, that we paſſed by them without any <hi>Examination.</hi> Then we rode up the <hi>Street</hi> to the <hi>Market-place,</hi> and by the <hi>Main-guard</hi> out at the <hi>Gate</hi> by the <hi>third Sentry:</hi> and ſo clear out at the <hi>Suburbs,</hi> and there came to an <hi>Inn,</hi> and ſet up our <hi>Horſes;</hi> it being the <hi>ſeventh Day</hi> of the <hi>Week.</hi> Now I ſaw and felt, that we had rid, as it were, againſt the <hi>Canon's Mouth,</hi> or the <hi>Sword's Point;</hi> but the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> and immediate <hi>Hand</hi> carried us over the <hi>Heads</hi> of them all. <hi>Next day</hi> I went up to the <hi>Meeting</hi> in the <hi>City, Friends</hi> having notice, that I would be at it: There came many <hi>Officers</hi> and <hi>Souldiers</hi> to it, and a glorious <hi>Meeting</hi> it was; and the Everlaſting <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God</hi> was ſet over the <hi>Nation,</hi> and his <hi>Son</hi> reigned in his glorious <hi>Power:</hi> and all was <hi>quiet,</hi> and no

            </p>
            <p>As we travelled along the <hi>Country,</hi> I ſpied a <hi>Steeple-houſe;</hi> and it <hi>ſtruck</hi> at my <hi>Life.</hi> I asked, what <hi>Steeple-houſe</hi> it was? and was An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,<note place="margin">Dunbar.</note> that it was <hi>Dunbar.</hi> When I came thither, and had ſet up at an <hi>Inn,</hi> I walked up to the <hi>Steeple-houſe,</hi> having a <hi>Friend</hi> or <hi>two</hi> with me.

               </q> He ſent me Word, <hi>That they were to have a</hi> Lecture <hi>there by the Ninth Hour; but that we might have our</hi> Meeting <hi>there by the</hi> Eighth Hour, <hi>if we would.</hi> We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded ſo; and deſired him to <hi>give Notice</hi> of it. Accordingly in the Morning both <hi>Poor</hi> and <hi>Rich</hi> came: And there being a <hi>Captain</hi> of <hi>Horſe</hi> quartered in the <hi>Town, He</hi> and his <hi>Troopers</hi> came alſo; ſo that we had a large <hi>Meeting:</hi> And a glorious <hi>Meeting</hi> it was, the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> being ſet over all. After ſome time the <hi>Prieſt</hi> came, and went into the <hi>Steeple-houſe:</hi> but we being in the <hi>Steeple-houſe-yard,</hi> moſt of the <hi>People</hi> ſtaid with us.

               <note place="margin">1657. Nottin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gham.</note> for ſome of the People were tender: yet I could not tell, how well to eſcape it.

So I told him, it was the <hi>Serpent</hi> in him, that had <hi>ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,</hi> and done hurt to ſuch as were <hi>Tender</hi> towards the <hi>Lord.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, if he did wait in the <hi>Fear</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> for the <hi>Seed</hi> of the <hi>Woman,</hi> Chriſt Jeſus, to bruiſe the <hi>Serpent</hi>'s <hi>Head</hi> in him, that had ſcattered, and done the hurt; by the <hi>Seed</hi> Chriſt Jeſus, (he coming into him) he might come to gather them again by this heavenly <hi>Seed:</hi> though it would be an <hi>hard work</hi> for him, to gather them again out of thoſe <hi>Vanities,</hi> he had led them into.</q> At this <hi>Rice Jones</hi> ſaid, <hi>Thou liest, it is not the</hi> Seed <hi>of the</hi> Woman, <hi>that bruiſes the Serpent's Head.</hi> 
               <q>No! ſaid I, What is it then? <hi>I ſay, it is the Law,</hi> ſaid he. But, ſaid I, the Scripture ſpeaking of the <hi>Seed</hi> of the <hi>VVoman,</hi> ſaith, <hi>It ſhall bruiſe thy Head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his Heel:</hi> Now, hath the <hi>Law</hi> an <hi>Heel;</hi> ſaid I, to be <hi>bruiſed?</hi>
               </q> Then <hi>Rice Jones</hi> and all his <hi>Company</hi> were at a ſtand: and I was moved in the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> to ſpeak to him, and ſay; <q>This <hi>Seed,</hi> Chriſt Jeſus, the <hi>Seed</hi> of the <hi>VVoman,</hi> which ſhould <hi>bruiſe</hi> the <hi>Serpent</hi>'s <hi>Head,</hi> ſhall <hi>bruiſe thy Head, and break you all to pieces.</hi>
               </q> Thus I did leave on the <hi>Heads</hi> of them the <hi>Seed, Christ:</hi> and not long after <hi>he</hi> and his <hi>Company ſcattered</hi> to <hi>pieces;</hi> and ſeveral of them came to be <hi>Friends,</hi> and ſtand to this Day.

But now was the time, that I was moved to go to them again, and it was of great <hi>Service;</hi> for many of them were brought to the <hi>Lord Jeſus Christ,</hi> and were ſettled upon him, ſitting down under his <hi>Teaching</hi> and <hi>Feeding,</hi> where they were kept <hi>freſh</hi> and <hi>green:</hi> and the others, that would not be gathered to him, ſoon after <hi>withered.</hi> This was that <hi>Rice Jones,</hi> that ſome Years before had ſaid; <hi>I was then at the highest, and ſhould fall:</hi> But, <hi>poor Man!</hi> he little thought, how near his own <hi>Fall</hi> was.</p>

                           <p>So <hi>Friends,</hi> this is the <hi>Word</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> to you all, be <hi>Watchful</hi> and <hi>Careful</hi> in all <hi>Meetings</hi> ye come into; for where <hi>Friends</hi> are ſitting together in <hi>ſilence,</hi> they are many times gathered into their own <hi>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</hi> Now, when a <hi>Man</hi> is come newly out of the <hi>World,</hi> from <hi>miniſtring</hi> to the <hi>World's People,</hi> he cometh out of the <hi>Dirt;</hi> and then he had need take heed, that he be not <hi>Raſh.</hi> For now, when he comes into a <hi>Silent Meeting,</hi> that is another <hi>State;</hi> then he muſt come, and <hi>feel</hi> his own <hi>Spirit,</hi> how it is, when he comes to them, that ſit <hi>ſilent:</hi> for if he be <hi>Raſh,</hi> they will <hi>judge him;</hi> that having been in the <hi>World,</hi> and amongſt the <hi>World,</hi> the <hi>Heat</hi> is not yet off him. For he may come in the <hi>Heat</hi> of his <hi>Spirit</hi> out of the <hi>World;</hi> whereas the <hi>others</hi> are <hi>ſtill</hi> and <hi>cool:</hi> and his <hi>Condition</hi> in that, not being agreeable to

                           <p>There is a great <hi>Danger</hi> too in <hi>Travelling</hi> abroad in the <hi>World:</hi> The ſame <hi>Power,</hi> that moves any to <hi>go forth,</hi> is that which muſt keep them. For it is the greateſt <hi>Danger</hi> to go abroad, except a Man be moved of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and go in the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Lord:</hi> for then, he keeping in the <hi>Power,</hi> is kept by it in his <hi>Journey,</hi> and in his <hi>Work;</hi> and it will enable him to anſwer the <hi>Tranſgreſſed,</hi> and keep above the <hi>Tranſgreſſor.</hi> And every one feeling the <hi>Danger</hi> to his own particular in <hi>Travelling</hi> abroad, there the pure <hi>Fear</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> will be placed, and kept in.

                           </p>
                           <p>So this is the <hi>Word</hi> of the <hi>Lord God</hi> to you all; <hi>Feel, that ye ſtand in the Preſence of the Lord:</hi> for every Man's <hi>Word</hi> ſhall be his <hi>Burden;</hi> but the <hi>Word</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> is pure, and anſwers the <hi>pure</hi> in every one. The <hi>word</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> is that, which was in the <hi>Beginning,</hi> and brings to the <hi>Beginning:</hi> It is an <hi>Hammer,</hi> to beat down the <hi>Tranſgreſſor</hi> (not the <hi>Tranſgreſſed</hi>) and as a <hi>Fire</hi> to burn up that, which is contrary to it. So <hi>Friends,</hi> come into that, which is over all the <hi>Spirits</hi> of the <hi>world,</hi> and fathoms all the <hi>Spirits</hi> of the <hi>world,</hi> and ſtands in the <hi>Patience;</hi> with that ye may ſee, where <hi>others</hi> ſtand, and reach <hi>that</hi> which is of <hi>God</hi> in every one. So here is no <hi>Strife,</hi> no <hi>Contention,</hi> out of <hi>Tranſgreſſion:</hi> for he that goeth into the <hi>Strife,</hi> and into the <hi>Contention,</hi> he is from the '<hi>pure Spirit.</hi> For where any goeth into the <hi>Contention,</hi> if any thing hath been begotten by him before, then that <hi>contentious Nature</hi> doth get a top, and ſpoil that, which was begotten; and q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>More was then ſpoken to many of theſe <hi>Particulars;</hi> which were not taken at large, as they were delivered.</p>
                           <p>After this <hi>Meeting</hi> was over, and moſt of the <hi>Friends</hi> gone away, as I was walking in <hi>John Crook</hi>'s Garden, there came a <hi>Party</hi> of <hi>Horſe,</hi> with a <hi>Conſtable,</hi> to <hi>ſeize</hi> on me.

Next day I paſſed from thence: and after I had viſited <hi>Friends</hi> in ſeveral places, as I went, I came to <hi>London;</hi> the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> accompanying me, and bearing me up in his <hi>Service.</hi>
                           </p>

                              <note place="margin">London.</note>I had not been long come to <hi>London,</hi> before I heard, that a <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> who came over with an <hi>Embaſſador</hi> from <hi>Spain,</hi> had challenged all the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> to <hi>diſpute</hi> with them at the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Newport</hi>'s Houſe: whereupon ſome <hi>Friends</hi> let him know, <hi>That we would meet him.</hi> Then he ſent us word, <hi>He would meet with</hi> Twelve <hi>of the Wiſeſt Learned-Men we had:</hi> A while after he ſent us word, <hi>He would meet with but</hi> Six; and after that he ſent us word again, <hi>He would have but</hi> Three <hi>to come.</hi> We <hi>haſt'ned</hi> what we could, leſt, for all his great <hi>Boaſt,</hi> he ſhould put it <hi>quite off</hi> at laſt. When we were come to the <hi>Houſe,</hi> I bid <hi>Nicholas Bond</hi> and <hi>Edward Burrough</hi> go up, and enter the <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> with him; and I would walk a while in the <hi>Yard,</hi> and then come up after them. I adviſed them to <hi>ſtate</hi> this <hi>Queſtion</hi> to him, <q>Whether or no the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as it now ſtood, was not degenerated from the true Church, which was in the Primitive Times, from the Life and Doctrine, and from the Power and Spirit, that they were in?</q> They <hi>ſtated</hi> the <hi>Queſtion</hi> accordingly; and the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> affirmed, <hi>That the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>now was in the Virginity and Purity of the Primitive Church.</hi> By this time I was come to them. Then we asked him, <q>
                                 <hi>Whether</hi> they had the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> poured out upon them, as the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had?</q> and he ſaid, <hi>No.</hi> Then ſaid I, <q>If ye have not the ſame <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> poured forth upon you, and the ſame <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had, then ye are <hi>degenerated</hi> from the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> which the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> was in.</q> So there needed little more to be ſaid to that. Then I asked him, <q>
                                 <hi>What Scripture</hi> they had for ſetting up <hi>Cloiſters</hi> for <hi>Nuns, Abbies</hi> and <hi>Monaſteries</hi> for <hi>Men,</hi> and for all their ſeveral <hi>Orders;</hi> and for their <hi>Praying</hi> by <hi>Beads,</hi> and to <hi>Images,</hi> and for making <hi>Croſſes,</hi> and for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding of <hi>Meats</hi> and <hi>Marriages,</hi> and for putting People to <hi>Death</hi> for <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion?</hi>

Then he told us of a <hi>written Word,</hi> and an <hi>unwritten Word.</hi> I asked him, <q>
                                 <hi>What</hi> he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his <hi>unwritten Word?</hi>
                              </q> He ſaid; <hi>The</hi> written <hi>Word is the Scriptures: and the</hi> unwritten <hi>Word is that, which the Apoſtles ſpake by Word of Mouth; which</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>are all thoſe Traditions, that we practiſe.</hi> Ibid him, Prove that by <hi>Scripture.</hi> Then he brought that <hi>Scripture,</hi> where the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſays (2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.5.) <hi>When I was with you, I told you theſe things. That is,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I told you of Nunneries and Monaſteries, and of putting to death for Religion, and of Praying by Beads, and to Images, and all the reſt of the Practices of the Church of</hi> Rome; <hi>which,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>was the</hi> unwritten Word <hi>of the Apoſtles, which they told then, and have ſince been continued down by Tradition unto theſe Times.</hi> 
                              <q>Then I deſired him to <hi>read</hi> that <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi> again, that he might ſee, how he had <hi>perverted</hi> the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s <hi>Words;</hi> for that, which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> there tells the <hi>Theſſalonians, he had told them before,</hi> is not an <hi>unwritten Word,</hi> but is there <hi>written down;</hi> namely, That the <hi>Man</hi> of <hi>Sin,</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Perdition</hi> ſhall be <hi>revealed,</hi> before that <hi>great</hi> and <hi>terrible Day</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which he was writing of, ſhould <hi>come:</hi> ſo this was not telling them any of thoſe things, that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> practiſes. In like manner, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> in the <hi>third Chapter</hi> of that <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,</hi> tells the <hi>Church</hi> of ſome <hi>diſorderly Perſons, he heard, were amongſt them, buſie-bodies, who did not work at all; concerning whom he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them by his</hi> unwritten Word, <hi>when he was among them, that if any would not work, neither ſhould he eat: which now he commands them again in his</hi> written Words <hi>in this</hi> Epiſtle, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. So this <hi>Scripture</hi> afforded no Proof for their invented <hi>Traditions;</hi>
                              </q> and he had no other <hi>Scripture-Proof</hi> to offer.

                           </p>
                           <p>After this he came to his <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Altar,</hi> beginning at the <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal Lamb,</hi> and the <hi>Shew-bread:</hi> and ſo came to the Words of Chriſt, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> and to what the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> writ of it to the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> Concluding, <hi>That after the Prieſt had Conſecrated the Bread and Wine, it was Immortal and Divine, and he that received it, received the whole Chriſt.</hi> I followed him through the <hi>Scriptures</hi> he brought, till I came to <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Words</hi> and the Apoſtle's; and I ſhewed him, <q>That the ſame <hi>Apoſtle</hi> told the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> after they had taken <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>VVine</hi> in Remembrance of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Death,</hi> that they were <hi>Reprobates, if Chriſt was not in them:</hi> But if the <hi>Bread</hi> they ate, was <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he muſt of neceſſity be <hi>in them,</hi> after they had <hi>eaten</hi> it.

                              </q> I obſerved to him alſo, <q>That both the <hi>Diſciples</hi> at the <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> and the <hi>Corinthians</hi> afterwards were to eat the <hi>Bread,</hi> and drink the <hi>VVine</hi> in <hi>Remembrance</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and to <hi>ſhew forth his Death, till he come;</hi> which plainly proves, the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>VVine,</hi> which they took, was not his <hi>Body.</hi> For if it had been his <hi>Real Body,</hi> that they ate, then he had been <hi>Come,</hi> and was then there <hi>preſent;</hi> and it had been <hi>impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> to have done ſuch a thing in <hi>Remembrance</hi> of him, if he had been then <hi>preſent</hi> with them: as he muſt have been, if that <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>VVine,</hi> which they <hi>ate</hi> and <hi>drank,</hi> had been his <hi>Real Body.</hi>
                              </q> Then as to thoſe
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:51448:185"/> Words of Chriſt, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> I told him, <q>

                                 <hi>So,</hi> ſaid I, are thoſe <hi>words</hi> of <hi>Christ, This is my Body.</hi>
                              </q> Now having ſtopt his Mouth as to <hi>Argument,</hi> I made the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> a <hi>Propoſal</hi> thus: <q>That ſeeing he ſaid, <hi>The Bread and VVine was Immortal and Divine, and the very Chriſt; and that whoſoever received it, received the whole Chriſt:</hi> Let a <hi>Meeting</hi> be Appointed between ſome of them (whom the <hi>Pope</hi> and his <hi>Cardinals</hi> ſhould Appoint) and <hi>ſome</hi> of <hi>us;</hi> and let a <hi>Bottle</hi> of <hi>VVine</hi> and <hi>Loaf</hi> of <hi>Bread</hi> be brought, and divided each into <hi>two Parts,</hi> and let them <hi>Conſecrate,</hi> which of thoſe <hi>Parts</hi> they would.

                                    <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nconſecrated?</hi> By this means, ſaid I, the <hi>Truth</hi> of this <hi>matter</hi> may be made manifeſt. And if the <hi>Conſecrated Bread</hi> and <hi>VVine</hi> change not, but retain their <hi>Savour</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs;</hi> this may be a <hi>Means</hi> to draw many to your <hi>Church:</hi> If they <hi>change,</hi> decay and loſe their <hi>Goodneſs;</hi> then ought you to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,</hi> and forſake your <hi>Error,</hi> and ſhed no more <hi>Blood</hi> about it: for much <hi>Blood</hi> hath been ſhed about theſe things; as in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Days.</q> To this the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> made this <hi>Reply: Take</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>a piece of New Cloth, and cut it into two pieces, and make two Garments of it; and put one of them upon King</hi> David<hi>'s Back, and the other upon a</hi> Beggar's: <hi>and the one Garment ſhall wear away, as well as the other.</hi> 
                              <q>Is this thy <hi>Anſwer,</hi> ſaid I? <hi>Yes,</hi> ſaid he.

                              </q> He replied no more to this, being willing to let it <hi>fall:</hi> for the <hi>People,</hi> that were preſent, <hi>ſaw</hi> his <hi>Error,</hi> and that he could not <hi>defend</hi> it. Then I asked him, <q>Why their <hi>Church</hi> did <hi>perſecute,</hi> and put People to <hi>Death</hi> for <hi>Religion?</hi>
                              </q> He replied, <hi>It was not the Church did it, but the Magiſtrates.</hi> I asked him, <q>
                                 <hi>Whether</hi> thoſe <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> were not counted and called <hi>Believers</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians?</hi>
                              </q> He ſaid, <hi>Yes:</hi> 
                              <q>Why then, ſaid I, Are they not <hi>Members</hi> of your <hi>Church?</hi>

                              <hi>Yes,</hi> ſaid he.

                     <head>To the Heads and Governours of this Nation, who have put forth a <hi>Declaration</hi> for the keeping of a Day of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn <hi>Faſting</hi> and <hi>Humiliation,</hi> for the Perſecution <hi>(as you ſay)</hi> of divers People beyond the Seas, profeſſing the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion, which, <hi>ye ſay,</hi> hath been tranſmitted unto them from their Anceſtors.</head>
                     <p>A <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> may be tranſmitted to Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, and ſo holden by Tradition; and in that, wherein the <hi>Profeſſion</hi> and Tradition is holden, is the <hi>Day</hi> of <hi>Humiliation</hi> kept; which ſtands in the <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>Man,</hi> which is not the <hi>Faſt,</hi> that the Lord requires, <hi>To bow down the Head like a Bulruſh, for a Day,</hi> and the Day following be in the ſame Condition, as they were the Day before. To the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> in your Conſciences do I ſpeak, which teſtifieth for God every Day, and witneſſeth againſt all <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Perſecution;</hi> which Meaſure of God, if ye be guided by it, doth not limit God to a <hi>Day,</hi> but leads to the <hi>Faſt,</hi> which the Lord requires, which is <hi>To looſe the Bonds of Wickedneſs, to undo the heavy Burdens, to break every Yoak, and to let the oppreſſed go free,</hi> Iſa. 58.6, 7. This is the <hi>Faſt</hi> the Lord requires; and this ſtands not in the Tranſmiſſion of <hi>Times,</hi> nor in the Traditions of Men: But this ſtands in that which was before <hi>Times</hi> were, and which leads out of <hi>Time,</hi> and ſhall be, when <hi>Time</hi> ſhall be no more. And theſe that teach for Doctrine the Commandments of Men, are they that ever perſecuted the Life and Power, when it came. And whereas ye mention a <hi>Decree</hi> or <hi>Edict,</hi> that was made againſt the ſaid <hi>Perſecuted Proteſtants;</hi> all ſuch <hi>Decrees</hi> or <hi>Edicts</hi> proceed from the Ground of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Religion and Supremacy, and therein ſtands his <hi>Tyranny</hi> and <hi>Cruelty,</hi> acted in that Will, which is in that Nature, which exerciſeth Lordſhip over one another, (as ye may read, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.42. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.25.) as all the <hi>Heathen</hi> do, and ever did; and in the <hi>Heatheniſh</hi> Nature is all the <hi>Tyranny</hi> and <hi>Perſecution</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, by them that are out of the Obedience to the <hi>Light</hi> of Chriſt Jeſus in the Conſcience, which is the Guider and Leader of all, who are tender of that of God in the Conſcience. But who are not led by this, know not what it is to <hi>ſuffer for Conſcience ſake.</hi> Now, whereas ye take into your Conſideration the ſad <hi>Perſecution, Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny</hi> and <hi>Cruelty</hi> exerciſed upon them, whom ye call your <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Brethren,</hi> and do Contribute and Adminiſter to their <hi>Wants</hi> outwardly; this is good in its place, and we own it; and ſee it good to adminiſter to the <hi>Neceſſities</hi> of others, and to do good to all: and we, who are <hi>Sufferers</hi> by a Law derived from the <hi>Pope,</hi> are willing to join, and to contribute with you to their outward <hi>Neceſſities.</hi> For <hi>the Earth is the Lord's, and the Fulneſs thereof;</hi> who is good to all, and gracious to all, and willing, that all ſhould

See what ye are doing, who profeſs the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> which were given forth by the Saints in <hi>Light,</hi> who dwelt in the <hi>Light</hi> and in the <hi>Life</hi> of them. For them, who do now witneſs the ſame <hi>Light,</hi> the ſame <hi>Life,</hi> and the ſame <hi>Power,</hi> which gave forth the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> which ye in Words profeſs, them ye <hi>perſecute,</hi> them ye <hi>hale out of your Synagogues</hi> and <hi>Markets;</hi> them ye <hi>beat, ſtock,</hi> and <hi>Impriſon.</hi> Now let that of God, in your Conſciences, which is <hi>juſt,</hi> and <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,</hi> and <hi>equal,</hi> examin and try, whether ye have any Example, or <hi>Precedent</hi> to exerciſe this <hi>Perſecution,</hi> which now many in this Nation ſuffer under, who are a People harmleſs and innocent, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Obedience towards God and Man? And though ye account the way of Truth, they walk in, <hi>Hereſie;</hi> yet therein do they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe themſelves, to have always a <hi>Conſcience void of Offence towards God and Man;</hi> as ye may read, the Saints of Old did; (<hi>Acts</hi> 24.14, 15, 16.) not wronging any Man, neither giving any juſt Cauſe of Offence; only being obedient to the Commands of the Lord, to declare as they are moved by the Holy Ghoſt; and ſtanding for the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of a <hi>Good Conſcience,</hi> ſpeaking the <hi>Truth</hi> in Chriſt, their Conſciences bearing them witneſs, that they lie not: For this do they <hi>ſuffer</hi> under you, who in Words profeſs the ſame thing, for which they <hi>ſuffer.</hi> Now ſee, if any Age or Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration did ever <hi>perſecute,</hi> as ye do? For ye <hi>profeſs</hi> Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, who <hi>Reveals</hi> the <hi>Father;</hi> and <hi>perſecute</hi> them, that witneſs the <hi>Revelation</hi> of the <hi>Father</hi> by Chriſt Jeſus unto them. Ye <hi>profeſs</hi> Chriſt Jeſus, who is the <hi>Light</hi> of the <hi>World, that enlightens every one, that cometh into the World;</hi> and yet <hi>perſecute</hi> them, that bear Witneſs and give Teſtimony to this <hi>Light.</hi> Ye <hi>profeſs,</hi> that the <hi>Word</hi> is become <hi>Fleſh;</hi> and yet <hi>perſecute</hi> them that witneſs it ſo. Ye <hi>profeſs,</hi> that whoſoever confeſſeth not, that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the Fleſh, is an <hi>Antichriſt;</hi> and yet <hi>perſecute</hi> them, that do Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs him come in the Fleſh, and call them <hi>Antichriſts</hi> and <hi>Deceivers.</hi> Ye <hi>profeſs,</hi> that the Kingdom of Chriſt is come; and yet <hi>perſecute</hi> them, that witneſs it come. Ye <hi>profeſs</hi> Chriſt Jeſus, the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and the Life; and yet <hi>perſecute</hi> them, that witneſs him to be ſo. If ye ſay, <hi>How ſhall we know, that theſe People, who ſay, they witneſs theſe things, do ſo, or no?</hi> I anſwer: Turn your Minds to the <hi>Light,</hi> which Chriſt Jeſus hath enlightned you withal, which is one in all; and if ye walk in the <hi>Light,</hi> ye ſhall have the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> and then ye will know and ſee, what ye have done, who have <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Glory</hi> (in his People) in whom is Life, and the <hi>Life</hi> is the <hi>Light</hi> of Men. To no other <hi>Touchſtone</hi> ſhall we turn you, but into your own <hi>Conſciences,</hi> and there ſhall ye find the <hi>Truth,</hi> of what we have declared unto you, and of what we bear Teſtimony to, according to the Holy Scriptures. And when the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:51448:187"/> 
                        <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Conſciences</hi> are opened, and all judged out of them, then ſhall ye Witneſs us to be of God, and our Teſtimony to be true; though now ye may ſtop your <hi>Ears,</hi> and harden your <hi>Hearts,</hi> while it is called to day: But then ye ſhall know, what ye have done, and whom ye have tranſgreſſed againſt; and then ye will ſee, that no <hi>Perſecutors,</hi> in any Age or Generation, that ever went before you, did ever <hi>Tranſgreſs</hi> againſt that <hi>Light,</hi> and Meaſure of God made manifeſt, in ſuch manner as ye have done. For though Chriſt and the Apoſtles were <hi>perſecuted</hi> in their times, the <hi>Jews</hi> (for the moſt part of them) did not know, that he was the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when he came, notwithſtanding that they had the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied of him; neither did they believe, that he was <hi>Riſen</hi> again, when the Apoſtles preached his <hi>Reſurrection.</hi> But ye ſay, <hi>Ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he is come;</hi> and ye ſay, <hi>Ye believe his Reſurrection;</hi> and yet ye <hi>perſecute</hi> thoſe that witneſs him come in the Fleſh, thoſe that are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with him in <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> thoſe that are conformable to his <hi>Death,</hi> and know the Power of his <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> thoſe ye <hi>perſecute,</hi> thoſe ye <hi>hale before Magiſtrates,</hi> and ſuffer to be <hi>beaten in your Synagogues;</hi> thoſe ye cauſe to be <hi>whipt,</hi> and <hi>ſtock't,</hi> and ſhamefully entreated, and into <hi>Priſon caſt,</hi> and <hi>kept;</hi> as many <hi>Goals</hi> in this Nation at this day teſtifie to your Faces. Therefore honeſtly conſider, what ye are doing, while ye are taking notice of others <hi>Cruelties,</hi> leſt ye over-look your own. There is ſome difference, in many things, between the <hi>Popiſh Religion,</hi> and that which ye call the <hi>Proteſtant;</hi> but in this <hi>Perſecution</hi> of yours there is no difference: For ye will Confeſs, that the Foundation of your <hi>Religion</hi> is grounded upon the <hi>Scriptures;</hi> and yet now ye are <hi>perſecuting</hi> them that be in the ſame Life, which they were in, who ſpake forth the <hi>Scriptures;</hi> your ſelves being the mean while under a <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of the <hi>Words</hi> they ſpake: and this ye ſhall one day witneſs. So ye have a <hi>Profeſſion</hi> and <hi>Form,</hi> and <hi>perſecute</hi> them that are in the <hi>Poſſeſſion,</hi> Life and Power. Therefore know aſſuredly, that ye muſt come to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for he is made manifeſt, to whom all Judgment is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Therefore to the <hi>Light</hi> of Chriſt Jeſus in your Conſciences, which ſearcheth and trieth you, turn your Minds, and ſtand ſtill, and wait there to receive the <hi>Righteous Law,</hi> which is according to that of God in the Conſcience, which is now riſing, and is bearing witneſs againſt all Ungodlineſs and Unrighteouſneſs of Men; and they whom ye <hi>perſecute,</hi> are manifeſt to God, and that of God in all Conſciences ſhall bear witneſs for us, that we are of God: And this ye ſhall one day witneſs, whether ye will hear or forbear. Our Rejoycing is in the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of our <hi>Conſciences,</hi> that in Simplicity and Godly Sincerity (not with Fleſhly Wiſdom, but by the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>God</hi>) we have had our Converſation in the World, not handling the Word of God deceitfully, but, in the Manifeſtation of the <hi>Truth;</hi> commending our ſelves to every Man's Conſcience in the ſight of God: and if our Goſpel be hid, it is hid to them that are loſt. And for the witneſſing the holding the Myſtery of <hi>Faith</hi> in a <hi>pure Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> do we ſuffer, and are ſubject for Conſcience ſake. This is thank-worthy, if a Man, for <hi>Conſcience ſake,</hi> endure Griefs and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering wrongfully. And in this is our Joy and Rejoicing, having
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:51448:188"/> a good Conſcience, that whereas we are evil ſpoken of, as <hi>Evil-Doers,</hi> they may be aſhamed, that falſly accuſe our good Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Chriſt; which is not only the putting away of the Filth of the Fleſh, but the Anſwer of a good <hi>Conſcience</hi> towards God, by the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt. And this we Witneſs made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, (Eternal Praiſes to the Living God) and bear Teſtimony to that, which ſpake it in the Apoſtle in Life and Power: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do we bear witneſs and teſtifie againſt thoſe, who, being got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>Form</hi> and <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of it, do perſecute the <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Power.</hi> Therefore to the Eternal <hi>Light</hi> of Chriſt Jeſus, the Searcher and Trier of all Hearts, turn your Minds, and ſee what ye are doing; leſt ye <hi>overturn your Foundation,</hi> and Bottom, whereon ye pretend to ſtand, while ye are <hi>profeſſing</hi> the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and perſecuting the <hi>Life, Light</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> which they were in, who gave them forth. For the <hi>Stone,</hi> cut out of the Mountains without Hands, is now ſtriking at the Feet of the Image, the <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> which is ſet up, and ſtands in the Will of Man. Now is that made manifeſt, unto which all muſt anſwer, and appear before the Judgment-Seat of Chriſt; that every one may receive the things done in his Body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad. Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore the <hi>Terror</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> we perſwade Men; but we are made manifeſt unto God, and ſhall be made manifeſt in all your Conſciences, which ye ſhall witneſs.</p>

            <p>Divers times, both in the time of the <hi>Long Parliament,</hi> and of the <hi>Protector</hi> (ſo called) and of the <hi>Committee of Safety,</hi> when they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed <hi>Faſts,</hi> I was moved to write to them, and tell them, their <hi>Faſts</hi> were like unto <hi>Jeſabels:</hi> For commonly, when they proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Faſts,</hi> there was ſome Miſchief contrived againſt us: And I knew, their <hi>Faſts</hi> were for Strife and Debate, to ſmite with the Fiſt of Wickedneſs; as the <hi>New-England-Profeſſors</hi> ſoon after did; who, before they put our <hi>Friends</hi> to Death, proclaimed a <hi>Faſt</hi> alſo.</p>
            <p>Now was it a time of great <hi>Suffering,</hi> and many <hi>Friends</hi> being in <hi>Priſons,</hi> many other <hi>Friends</hi> were moved to go to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> to offer up themſelves to lie in the ſame <hi>Dungeons,</hi> where their <hi>Friends</hi> lay, that they, that were in <hi>Priſon,</hi> might go forth, and not periſh in the ſtinking <hi>Dungeons</hi> and <hi>Goals.</hi> And this we did in Love to God and our Brethren, that they might not <hi>die</hi> in <hi>Priſon;</hi> and in love to them, that caſt them in, that they might not bring <hi>Innocent Blood</hi> upon their own Heads; which we knew would cry to the Lord, and bring his Wrath, Vengeance and Plagues upon them. But little Favour could we find from thoſe Profeſſing <hi>Parliaments;</hi> but inſtead thereof they would be in a Rage, and ſometimes threaten thoſe <hi>Friends,</hi> that thus attended them, that they would <hi>whip</hi> them, and ſend them home. Then commonly ſoon after the Lord would turn them out, and ſend them home; who had not an Heart to do good in the Day of their Power. But they went not off without being forewarned: For I was moved to write to them, in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral turns, as I did to the <hi>Long-Parliament,</hi> unto whom I declared,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:51448:188"/> before they were broken up, That thick <hi>Darkneſs</hi> was coming over them all, even a Day of <hi>Darkneſs</hi> that ſhould be felt.</p>
            <p>And becauſe the <hi>Parliament,</hi> that now ſate, was made up moſtly of high <hi>Profeſſors,</hi> who pretending to be more Religious than others, were indeed greater <hi>Perſecutors</hi> of them, that were truly <hi>Religious,</hi> I was moved to ſend them the following Lines, as a Reproof of their <hi>Hypocriſie:</hi>

Eſſex.</note>From <hi>Kingſton</hi> I went to <hi>Iſaac Penington</hi>'s, in <hi>Buckinghamſhire,</hi> where I had appointed a <hi>Meeting;</hi> and the Lord's Truth and Power was preciouſly manifeſted amongſt us. After I had Viſited Friends in thoſe parts, I returned to <hi>London:</hi> And ſoon after went into <hi>Eſſex;</hi> where I had not been long, before I heard, that the <hi>Protector</hi> was <hi>dead,</hi> and his Son <hi>Richard</hi> made <hi>Protector</hi> in his Room. Whereupon I came up to <hi>London</hi> again.<note place="margin">London.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And before this time the <hi>Church-Faith</hi> (ſo called) was given forth, which was ſaid to be made at the <hi>Savoy</hi> in <hi>Eleven Days</hi> time. I got a <hi>Copy</hi> of it, before it was publiſhed, and writ an <hi>Anſwer</hi> to it: And when their <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Church-Faith</hi> was ſold up and down the Streets, my <hi>Anſwer</hi> to it was ſold alſo. This angred ſome of the <hi>Parliament-Men;</hi> ſo that one of them told me, <hi>They muſt have me to</hi> Smithfield. I told him, I was over their <hi>Fires,</hi> and feared them not. And reaſoning with him, I wiſh'd him to conſider; Had all People been without a <hi>Faith</hi> theſe <hi>Sixteen hundred Years,</hi> that now the <hi>Prieſts</hi> muſt make them one? Did not the Apoſtle ſay, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was the <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>Finiſher</hi> of their <hi>Faith?</hi> And ſince Chriſt Jeſus was the Author of the <hi>Apoſtles Faith,</hi> and of the <hi>Churches Faith</hi> in the Primitive Times, and of the <hi>Martyrs Faith,</hi> ſhould not all People look unto him to be the <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>Finiſher</hi> of their <hi>Faith,</hi> and not unto the <hi>Prieſts?</hi> A great deal of work we had about the <hi>Prieſts made Faith:</hi> For they called us <hi>Houſe-creepers, leading ſilly Women Captive,</hi> becauſe We <hi>Met</hi> in <hi>Houſes,</hi> and would not hold up their <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Temples,</hi> which they had made and ſet up. But I told them, that it was they, that <hi>Led ſilly Women Captive,</hi> and <hi>Crept into Houſes,</hi> who kept People always Learning under them, who were Covetous, and had got a Form of Godlineſs, but denied the Power and Spirit, which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles were in. Such began to <hi>Creep</hi> in the Apoſtles Days; but now they had got the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> on their ſide, who upheld thoſe <hi>Houſes</hi> for them, which they had <hi>Crept</hi> into, their <hi>Temples,</hi> with their <hi>Tithes:</hi> Whereas the Apoſtles brought People off from even that <hi>Temple,</hi> and thoſe <hi>Tithes</hi> and <hi>Offerings,</hi> which God had for a time Commanded. And the Apoſtles <hi>Met</hi> in ſeveral private <hi>Houſes,</hi> being to Preach the Goſpel in all Nations; which they did <hi>freely,</hi> as Chriſt had commanded them. And ſo do we, who bring People off from theſe <hi>Prieſts, Temples</hi> and <hi>Tithes</hi> (which God never Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded) to Meet in <hi>Houſes,</hi> or on <hi>Mountains,</hi> as the Saints of old did, who were gathered in the Name of Jeſus; and Chriſt was their <hi>Prophet, Prieſt</hi> and <hi>Shepherd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was preſent, with the <hi>Parliament-Man,</hi> that I diſcourſed with, one <hi>Major Wiggan,</hi> a very envious Man; yet he bridled himſelf before the <hi>Parliament-Man,</hi> and ſome others that were there in Company. He took upon him to make a Speech, and ſaid, <hi>Chriſt had taken away the Guilt of Sin, but had left the Power of Sin remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in us.</hi> I told him, that was ſtrange Doctrine: For Chriſt came to deſtroy the <hi>Devil</hi> and his Works, and the Power of Sin, and ſo to cleanſe Men from Sin.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Major Wiggan</hi>'s Mouth was ſtopt at that time. But the <hi>next day</hi> deſiring to ſpeak with me again, I took a <hi>Friend</hi> or two with me, and went to him. Then he vented a great deal of <hi>Paſſion</hi> and
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:51448:189"/> 
               <hi>Rage,</hi> beyond the Bounds of a Chriſtian, or Moral Man:<note place="margin">1658. London.</note> Whereupon I was made to reprove him: And having brought the Lord's Power over him, and let him ſee, what Condition he was in, I left him.</p>
            <p>After ſome time I paſſed out of <hi>London,</hi> and had a <hi>Meeting</hi> at <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant Birkheads</hi> at <hi>Twitnam;</hi> to which many People came,<note place="margin">Twitnam.</note> and ſome of conſiderable Quality in the World. A glorious <hi>Meeting</hi> it was, wherein the Scriptures were largely and clearly opened, and Chriſt exalted above all, to the great Satisfaction of the Hearers.</p>
            <p>But there was great <hi>Perſecution</hi> in many places, both by <hi>Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning,</hi> and breaking up of <hi>Meetings,</hi> At a <hi>Meeting</hi> about Seven Miles from <hi>London,</hi> the <hi>Rude People</hi> uſually came out of ſeveral Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes round about, to abuſe <hi>Friends,</hi> and did often <hi>beat</hi> and <hi>bruiſe</hi> them exceedingly. One day they <hi>beat</hi> and <hi>abuſed</hi> about <hi>Eighty Friends,</hi> that went to that <hi>Meeting</hi> out of <hi>London,</hi> tearing their <hi>Coats</hi> and <hi>Cloaks</hi> from off their Backs, and throwing them into <hi>Ditches</hi> and <hi>Ponds;</hi> and when they had beſmeared them with Dirt, then they ſaid, <hi>They look'd like Witches.</hi> The next <hi>Firſt-day</hi> after this,<note place="margin">A Meeting near <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>
               </note> I was moved of the Lord to go to that <hi>Meeting,</hi> though at that time I was very weak. When I came there, I bid <hi>Friends</hi> bring a <hi>Table,</hi> and ſet it in the <hi>Cloſe,</hi> where they uſed to <hi>Meet,</hi> to ſtand upon. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their wonted courſe, the <hi>Rude People</hi> came, and I having a Bible in my hand, ſhewed them theirs and their <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Teachers Fruits;</hi> and the People came to be aſhamed, and was quiet: And ſo I opened the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to them, and our <hi>Principles</hi> agreeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; and I turned the People from the Darkneſs, to the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and his Spirit, by which they might underſtand the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> and ſee themſelves and their Sins, and know Chriſt Jeſus to be their Saviour. So the <hi>Meeting</hi> ended quietly, and the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> came over all, to his Glory. But it was a time of great <hi>Sufferings;</hi> for beſides the <hi>Impriſonments,</hi> (through which many <hi>died</hi> in <hi>Priſons</hi>) our <hi>Meetings</hi> were greatly diſturbed: For they have thrown <hi>Rotten Eggs</hi> and <hi>Wild-fire</hi> into our <hi>Meetings,</hi> and have brought in <hi>Drums</hi> beating, and <hi>Kettles,</hi> to make Noiſes with, that the Truth might not be heard; and among theſe, the <hi>Prieſts</hi> as Rude as any: as may be ſeen in the Book of the <hi>Fighting</hi> Prieſts, wherein a <hi>Liſt</hi> is given of ſome of the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> that had actually <hi>beaten</hi> and <hi>abuſed Friends.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many alſo of our <hi>Friends</hi> were brought up to <hi>London, Priſoners,</hi> to be Tried before the <hi>Committee;</hi> where <hi>Henry Vane</hi> being <hi>Chair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> would not ſuffer <hi>Friends</hi> to come in, except they would <hi>put off</hi> their <hi>Hats:</hi> but at laſt the Lord's Power came over him, ſo that, through the Mediation of ſome others, that perſwaded him, they were admitted. Now many of us having been <hi>Impriſoned</hi> upon <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts</hi> (as they called them) for <hi>not putting off our Hats,</hi> it was not a likely thing, that <hi>Friends,</hi> who had ſuffered ſo long for it from others, ſhould <hi>put off their Hats</hi> to him. But the Lord's Power came over them all, and wrought ſo, that ſeveral <hi>Friends</hi> were ſet at Liberty by them. Now inaſmuch as <hi>Sufferings</hi> grew very ſharp, I was moved of the Lord to write a few Lines, and ſend abroad amongſt <hi>Friends,</hi> to encourage them to go on faithfully and boldly through the Exerciſes of the day; of which a Copy here follows:

                        <hi>My Dear Friends,</hi> every where abroad, ſcattered in <hi>Priſon,</hi> or out of <hi>Priſon;</hi> Fear not, becauſe of the Reports of <hi>Sufferings;</hi> let not the <hi>Evil Spies</hi> of the Good Land make you afraid, if they tell you, the <hi>Walls are high,</hi> and that there be <hi>Anakims in the Land:</hi> For at the blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Ram's-Horns</hi> did the <hi>Walls</hi> of <hi>Jericho</hi> fall down; and they that brought the Evil Report, periſhed in the Wilderneſs.

            <p>Now after a while I paſſed into the Country, and went to <hi>Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reading.</note> and was there under great <hi>Sufferings</hi> and <hi>Exerciſes,</hi> and in a great Travel in my Spirit for about <hi>Ten Weeks</hi> time: For I ſaw, there was great <hi>Confuſion</hi> and <hi>Distraction</hi> amongſt the People, and that the <hi>Powers</hi> were plucking each other to pieces. And I ſaw, how many Men were deſtroying the Simplicity, and betraying the <hi>Truth,</hi> and a great deal of <hi>Hypocriſie,</hi> and <hi>Deceit,</hi> and <hi>Strife</hi> was got upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in the People, ſo that they were ready to ſheath their <hi>Swords</hi> in one anothers <hi>Bowels.</hi> There had been a Tenderneſs in many of them formerly, when they were low; but when they were got up, and had killed, and taken Poſſeſſion, they came to be as bad as others: So that we had much to do with them about our <hi>Hats,</hi> and ſaying <hi>Thou</hi> and <hi>Thee</hi> to them. For they turned their Profeſſion of <hi>Patience</hi> and <hi>Moderation</hi> into <hi>Rage</hi> and <hi>Madneſs;</hi> and many of them would be like diſtracted Men for this <hi>Hat-Honour.</hi> For they had hardned themſelves by <hi>perſecuting</hi> the Innocent, and were at this time Crucifying the <hi>Seed, Chriſt,</hi> both in themſelves and others; till at laſt they fell a biting and devouring one another, until they were <hi>Conſumed</hi> one of another; who had turned againſt, and judged, that which God had wrought in them, and ſhewed unto them. So ſhortly after God overthrew them, and turned them upſide down, and brought the <hi>King</hi> over them, who were often ſurmiſing, that the <hi>Quakers Met</hi> together to bring in <hi>King Charles,</hi> (when as <hi>Friends</hi> did not concern themſelves with the outward <hi>Powers,</hi> or <hi>Government.</hi>) But at laſt the <hi>Lord</hi> brought him in, and many of them (when they ſaw, he would be brought in) <hi>Voted</hi> for the bringing him in So with Heart and Voice praiſe the <hi>Name</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> to whom it
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:51448:190"/> doth belong; who over all hath the <hi>Supremacy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1658. Reading.</note> and who will Rock the Nations, for he is over them. Now I had a <hi>Sight</hi> and <hi>Senſe</hi> of the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Return</hi> a good while before, and ſo had ſome others. I writ to <hi>Oliver</hi> ſeveral times, and let him know, that while he was <hi>perſecuting God's People,</hi> they whom he accounted his <hi>Enemies,</hi> were preparing to come upon him. And when ſome forward Spirits, that came amongſt us, would have bought <hi>Somerſet-Houſe,</hi> that we might have <hi>Meetings</hi> in it; I forbad them to do ſo: For I did then foreſee the <hi>King's Coming in</hi> again. Beſides, there came a <hi>Woman</hi> to me in the <hi>Strand,</hi> who had a <hi>Prophecy</hi> concerning <hi>King</hi> Charles<hi>'s coming in, three Years</hi> before he came; and ſhe told me, ſhe muſt go to him to declare it. I adviſed her to wait upon the Lord, and keep it to her ſelf: For if it ſhould be known, that ſhe went on ſuch a Meſſage, they would look upon it to be <hi>Treaſon:</hi> But ſhe ſaid, She muſt go, and tell him, that he ſhould be brought into <hi>England</hi> again. I ſaw, her <hi>Prophecy</hi> was true, and that a great <hi>Stroke</hi> muſt come upon them in <hi>Power:</hi> For they that had then gotten <hi>Poſſeſſion,</hi> were ſo exceeding high, and ſuch great <hi>Perſecution</hi> was acted by them, who called them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>Saints,</hi> that they would take from <hi>Friends</hi> their <hi>Copyhold-Lands,</hi> becauſe they could not <hi>Swear</hi> in their <hi>Courts.</hi> And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, when we laid theſe <hi>Sufferings</hi> before <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> he would not believe it. Wherefore <hi>Thomas Aldam</hi> and <hi>Anthony Pearſon</hi> were moved to go through all the <hi>Goals</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and to get <hi>Copies</hi> of <hi>Friends Commitments</hi> under the <hi>Goalers</hi> Hands, that they might lay the Weight of <hi>Friends Sufferings</hi> upon <hi>Oliver Cromwel.</hi> And when he would not give Order for the <hi>Releaſing</hi> of them, <q>
                  <hi>Thomas Aldam</hi> was moved to take his <hi>Cap</hi> from off his Head, and to <hi>Rend it in pieces</hi> before him, and to ſay unto him, <hi>So ſhall thy Government be Rent from Thee and thy Houſe.</hi> Another <hi>Friend</hi> alſo, a <hi>Woman,</hi> was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to go to the <hi>Parliament</hi> (that was envious againſt <hi>Friends</hi>) with a <hi>Pitcher</hi> in her hand, which ſhe <hi>brake into pieces</hi> before them, and told them, <hi>So ſhould they be broken to pieces:</hi>
               </q> Which came to paſs ſhortly after. And in my great <hi>Suffering,</hi> and <hi>Travel</hi> of <hi>Spirit</hi> for the Nation, being grievouſly burdened, and almoſt choked with their <hi>Hypocriſie, Treachery</hi> and <hi>Falſneſs,</hi> I ſaw, God would bring that a top of them, which they had been a top of; and that all muſt be brought down to that, which did <hi>Convince</hi> them, before they could get over that <hi>bad Spirit within</hi> and <hi>without:</hi> For it is the pure, Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible <hi>Spirit,</hi> that doth, and only can work down all <hi>Deceit</hi> in People.</p>
            <p>Now while I was under that ſore <hi>Travel</hi> at <hi>Reading,</hi> by reaſon of Grief and Sorrow of Mind, and the great Exerciſe that was upon my Spirit, my <hi>Countenance</hi> was alter'd, and I looked poor and thin; and there came a Company of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean Spirits</hi> to me, and told me; <hi>The Plagues of God were upon me:</hi> But I told them, It was the ſame <hi>Spirit</hi> ſpake that in them, that ſaid ſo of <hi>Christ,</hi> when he was ſtricken and ſmitten; they <hi>hid their Face</hi> from him. But when I had travelled with the <hi>Witneſs</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which they had quenched, and had gotten through with it, and over all that <hi>Hypocriſie,</hi> which the <hi>Outſide-Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors</hi> were run into, and ſaw, how that would be brought down, and turned under, and that <hi>Life</hi> would riſe over it, I came to have
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:51448:191"/> Eaſe; and the <hi>Light, Power</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> ſhined over all. And then, having <hi>Recovered,</hi> and got through my <hi>Travels</hi> and <hi>Sufferings,</hi> my Body and Face <hi>ſwelled,</hi> when I came abroad into the Air; and then the bad Spirits ſaid, <hi>I was grown fat;</hi> and they Envied at that alſo: So I ſaw, that no Condition nor State would pleaſe that Spirit of theirs. But the Lord preſerved me by his <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> through and over all;<note place="margin">London.</note> and in the Lord's Power I came to <hi>London</hi> again.</p>
            <p>Now was there a great Pudder made about the Image or <hi>Effigies</hi> of <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> lying in State, Men ſtanding and ſounding with <hi>Trumpets</hi> over his <hi>Image,</hi> after he was <hi>dead.</hi> At this my Spirit was greatly grieved, and the Lord, I found, was highly offended. Then did I write the following Lines unto them, and ſent among them, to Reprove their <hi>Wickedneſs,</hi> and warn them to <hi>Repent.</hi>

And all ſuch as profeſs themſelves to be <hi>Miniſters</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and go about to beat down the <hi>Whore</hi> with outward, carnal Weapons, the <hi>Fleſh</hi> and the <hi>Whore</hi> are got up in themſelves, and they are in a <hi>blind Zeal:</hi> For the <hi>Whore</hi> got up by the Inward Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening from the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> and the beating down of the <hi>Whore</hi> muſt be by the inward Stroke of the <hi>Sword</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> within. All ſuch as pretend Chriſt Jeſus, and confeſs him, and yet run into the uſe of <hi>Carnal Weapons,</hi> wreſtling with Fleſh and Blood, throw away the <hi>Spiritual Weapons.</hi> They that would be <hi>Wreſtlers</hi> with <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> throw away Chriſt's Doctrine, and <hi>Fleſh</hi> is got up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and they are weary of their Sufferings. And ſuch as would <hi>Revenge</hi> themſelves, be out of Chriſt's Doctrine. And ſuch as being ſtricken on the one Cheek, would not turn the other, be out of Chriſt's Doctrine. And ſuch as do not <hi>love one another,</hi> and <hi>love Enemies,</hi> be out of Chriſt's Doctrine. Therefore ye, that be Heirs of the <hi>Bleſſings</hi> of God, which were before the <hi>Curſe</hi> and the <hi>Fall</hi> was, come to Inherit your Portions: And ye that be Heirs of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> which was before the <hi>Devil</hi> was, live in the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> ſeeking the Peace of all Men, and the Good of all Men: and live in Chriſt, who came to <hi>ſave men's lives,</hi> out of <hi>Adam</hi> in the <hi>Fall,</hi> where they <hi>deſtroy men's lives,</hi> and live not in him. For the <hi>Jews Sword</hi> outwardly, by which they cut down the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,</hi> was a Type of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> within, which cuts down the <hi>Heatheniſh Nature</hi> within. So live in the peaceable Kingdom of Chriſt Jeſus, and live in the <hi>Peace</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and not in the <hi>Luſts,</hi> from whence <hi>Wars</hi> ariſe, and live in Chriſt, the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> the Way of God, who is the <hi>Second Adam,</hi> that never fell; but live not in <hi>Adam</hi> in the Fall, in the Deſtruction, where they deſtroy one another. Therefore come out of <hi>Adam</hi> in the Fall, into the <hi>Adam</hi> that never fell; and ſo live in Love and Peace with all Men: and keep out of all the Buſlings in the World, and meddle not with the <hi>Powers</hi> of the Earth; but mind the Kingdom, the <hi>Way</hi> of <hi>Peace.</hi> Ye that be <hi>Heirs</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>Heirs</hi> of the Kingdom, and <hi>Heirs</hi> of the Goſpel, and <hi>Heirs</hi> of Salvation, and <hi>Saints</hi> of the moſt-High, and <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> whoſe Converſations are in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that is above the Combuſtions of the Earth, let your <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation</hi> Preach to all Men, and your Innocent Lives, that they which ſpeak Evil of you, beholding your <hi>Godly Converſation,</hi> may glorifie your Father, which is in Heaven. And all <hi>Friends</hi> every where, this I charge you, which is the Word of the Lord God unto you all, <hi>Live in Peace, in Chriſt the way of Peace;</hi> and therein ſeek the <hi>Peace</hi> of all Men, and no Man's Hurt. As I ſaid before, in <hi>Adam</hi> in the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:51448:192"/> Fall is no <hi>Peace;</hi> but in <hi>Adam</hi> out of the Fall, in him is the <hi>Peace:</hi> So ye being in <hi>Adam,</hi> which never fell, it is <hi>Love</hi> that overcomes, and not <hi>Hatred</hi> with <hi>Hatred,</hi> nor <hi>Strife</hi> with <hi>Strife.</hi> Therefore live all in the peaceable Life, doing good to all Men, and ſeeking the Good and Welfare of all Men.</p>

            <p>Now after I had ſtaid ſome time in <hi>London,</hi> and had viſited <hi>Friends Meetings</hi> there and there-abouts, and the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> was ſet over all, I travelled into the Countries again,<note place="margin">Eſſex. Suffolk. Norfolk. <hi>Norwich.</hi>
               </note> paſſing through <hi>Eſſex</hi> and <hi>Suffolk</hi> into <hi>Norfolk,</hi> viſiting <hi>Friends;</hi> till I came to <hi>Norwich,</hi> where we had a <hi>Meeting</hi> about the time called <hi>Chriſtmas.</hi> The <hi>Mayor</hi> of <hi>Norwich,</hi> having got notice before-hand of the <hi>Meeting</hi> I intended to have there, granted out a <hi>Warrant</hi> to apprehend me. Wherefore when I was come thither, and heard of the <hi>Warrant,</hi> I ſent ſome <hi>Friends</hi> to the <hi>Mayor</hi> to Reaſon with him about it. His Anſwer was, The <hi>Souldiers</hi> ſhould not <hi>Meet;</hi> and did <hi>We</hi> think to <hi>Meet?</hi> He would have had us gone out and <hi>Met</hi> without the City: For he ſaid, the <hi>Towns-People</hi> were ſo <hi>rude,</hi> that he could hardly order them, and he feared, that our <hi>Meeting</hi> would make <hi>Tumults</hi> in the Town. But our <hi>Friends</hi> told him, we were a peaceable People, and that he ought to keep the <hi>Peace;</hi> for we could not but <hi>Meet</hi> to <hi>Worſhip God,</hi> as our manner was. So he became pretty moderate, and did not ſend his <hi>Officers</hi> to the <hi>Meeting.</hi> A large <hi>Meeting</hi> it was, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of rude People came, with an intent to have done Miſchief: But the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> came over them, ſo that they were Chained by it, though ſeveral <hi>Prieſts</hi> were there, and <hi>Profeſſors,</hi> and <hi>Ranters.</hi> Among the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> one, whoſe Name was <hi>Townſend,</hi> ſtood up and Cryed; <hi>Error, Blaſphemy</hi> and an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly Meeting?</hi> I bad him not burden himſelf with that, which he could not make good; and I ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, what was our <hi>Error</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemy:</hi> For I told him, he ſhould make good his Words, before I had done with him, or be ſhamed. As for an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly Meeting,</hi> I ſaid, I did believe there were many People there, that <hi>feared God,</hi> and therefore it was both Unchriſtian and Uncivil in him, to charge Civil, <hi>Godly People</hi> with an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly Meeting.</hi> He ſaid, My <hi>Error</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> was, in that I ſaid, that <hi>People muſt wait upon God</hi> by his Power and Spirit, and feel his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, when they did not ſpeak <hi>Words:</hi> I asked him then, Whether the Apoſtles, and Holy Men of God, did not hear <hi>God ſpeak</hi> to them in their <hi>Silence,</hi> before they ſpake forth the Scripture, and before it was written? He replied, <hi>Yes: David</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi> did <hi>hear God,</hi> before they did <hi>Pen</hi> the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and felt his Preſence in <hi>Silence,</hi> before they ſpake them forth. Then ſaid I, All People take notice, he ſaid, this was <hi>Error</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> in me to ſay theſe Words; and now he hath confeſſed, it is no more, than the <hi>Holy Men</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in former times witneſſed. So I ſhewed the People, that as the <hi>Holy Men</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> who gave forth the Scriptures, as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt, did <hi>hear</hi> and <hi>learn</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> before they ſpake them forth: So muſt They all hearken, and <hi>hear</hi> what the <hi>Spirit</hi> ſaith, which will lead them into all Truth, that they may know God,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:51448:193"/> and Chriſt,<note place="margin">1659. Norwich.</note> and may underſtand the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> O ſaid the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> this is not that <hi>George Fox</hi> I would ſpeak withal; this is a ſubtile Man, ſaid he. So the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> came over all, and the rude People were made moderate, and were reached by it; and ſome <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors,</hi> that were there, called to the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Prove the</hi> Blaſphemy <hi>and</hi> Errors, <hi>which ye have charged them with: Ye have ſpoken much againſt them behind their Backs, but nothing ye can prove now</hi> (ſaid they) <hi>to their Faces.</hi> But the <hi>Prieſt</hi> began to get away: Whereupon I told him, we had many things to charge him withal, therefore let him ſet a <hi>time</hi> and <hi>place</hi> to anſwer them; which he did, and went his ways. A glorious Day this was: For <hi>Truth</hi> came o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all, and People were turned to God by his <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> and to the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> their <hi>free Teacher,</hi> who was Exalted over all. And as we paſſed away, generally Peoples Hearts were filled with Love towards us; yea, the Ruder ſort of them deſired another <hi>Meeting:</hi> For the evil Intentions that they had againſt us, were thrown out of their Hearts. At Night I paſſed out of Town to a <hi>Friend</hi>'s Houſe,<note place="margin">Col. Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis.</note> and from thence to <hi>Col. Dennis</hi>'s, where we had a great <hi>Meeting:</hi> And afterwards travelled on through the Countries, viſiting <hi>Friends</hi> up and down in <hi>Norfolk,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Norfollk.</hi> Hunts. Cambridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</note> 
               <hi>Huntingtonſhire</hi> and <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgeſhire,</hi> But <hi>George Whitehead</hi> and <hi>Richard Huberthorn</hi> ſtaid about <hi>Norwich,</hi> to meet the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> who was ſoon Confounded and down, the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> came ſo over him.</p>
            <p>After I had travelled through many Countries in the Lord's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and many were <hi>Convinced,</hi> notwithſtanding that in ſome places the People were very Rude; I returned to <hi>London</hi> again, when <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Monk</hi> was come up thither,<note place="margin">London.</note> and the <hi>Gates</hi> and <hi>Poſts</hi> of the <hi>City</hi> were pulling down. <q>Long before this I had a <hi>Viſion,</hi> wherein I ſaw the <hi>City</hi> lie in <hi>heaps,</hi> and the <hi>Gates</hi> down; and it was then repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to me, juſt as I ſaw it, ſeveral Years after lying in <hi>heaps,</hi> when it was burned.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Divers times had I, both by Word and Writing, forewarned the ſeveral <hi>Powers,</hi> both in <hi>Oliver</hi>'s time and after, of the <hi>Day</hi> of <hi>Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,</hi> that was coming upon them: But they rejecting Counſel, and ſlighting thoſe <hi>Viſitations</hi> of <hi>Love</hi> to them, I was moved now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were quite overturned, to lay their <hi>Back-ſliding, Hypocriſie</hi> and <hi>Treacherous Dealing</hi> before them, thus:

The <hi>Prieſt</hi> of the Town was in a great Rage, but did not come out of his Houſe; wherefore, hearing him make a great Noiſe in his Houſe, as we were paſſing from the <hi>Meeting,</hi> we bid him <hi>Come out into the Street, and we would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with him;</hi> but he would not. So the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> being over all, <hi>Friends</hi> were refreſhed in the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Truth.</hi> From thence I went to another <hi>Market-Town,</hi> where in the Evening we had a precious <hi>Meeting;</hi> and the freſh Senſe of the <hi>Preſence</hi> of the <hi>Lord God</hi> was ſweetly felt amongſt us.<note place="margin">

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Dorcheſter</note>At <hi>Dorcheſter</hi> we had a great <hi>Meeting</hi> in the Evening at our <hi>Inn,</hi> to which many <hi>Souldiers</hi> came, and were pretty Civil. But the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables</hi> and <hi>Officers</hi> of the Town came, under pretence to look for a <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> whoſe Head (they ſaid) was ſhaved: And they would have all to <hi>put off their Hats,</hi> or elſe they would take them off, to look for the <hi>Jeſuit's ſhaven Crown.</hi> So they took off my <hi>Hat</hi> (for I was the Man they aimed at) and they looked very narrowly; but not finding any <hi>bald</hi> or <hi>ſhaven place</hi> on my <hi>Head,</hi> they went away with <hi>ſhame;</hi> and the <hi>Souldiers,</hi> and other ſober People were greatly offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them.

            </p>
            <p>From thence we paſſed into <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi> where the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and other <hi>Profeſſors</hi> were very wicked, and often uſed to diſturb <hi>Friends Meetings.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Example.</note> 
               <q>One time eſpecially (as we were then informed) there was a very <hi>wicked</hi> Man, whom they had got to come to the <hi>Quakers Meeting.</hi> This <hi>Man</hi> put a <hi>Bears-Skin</hi> on his Back, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook with that to <hi>play Pranks</hi> in the <hi>Quakers Meeting.</hi> Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, ſetting himſelf juſt oppoſite to the <hi>Friend,</hi> that was ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he <hi>Lolled his Tongue out of his Mouth, having his Bears-Skin on his Back,</hi> and ſo made ſport to his Wicked Followers, and cauſed a great Diſturbance in the <hi>Meeting.</hi> But an Eminent <hi>Judgment</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took him, and his <hi>Puniſhmet</hi> ſlumbred not: For as he went back from the <hi>Meeting,</hi> there was a <hi>Bull-baiting</hi> in the way, which he ſtayed to ſee; and coming within the <hi>Bulls</hi> reach, the <hi>Bull</hi> ſtruck his <hi>Horn</hi> under the Man's Chin into his <hi>Throat,</hi> and ſtruck his <hi>Tongue</hi> out of his <hi>Mouth,</hi> ſo that it hung <hi>Lolling</hi> out, as he had uſed it before, in Deriſion, in the <hi>Meeting.</hi> And the <hi>Bull's Horn</hi> running up into the

            </p>
            <p>We travelled through <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi> and <hi>Devonſhire,</hi>

            <p>While I was in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> there were great <hi>Ship-wracks</hi> about the <hi>Lands-End.</hi> Now it was the Cuſtom of that Country, that at ſuch a time both <hi>Rich</hi> and <hi>Poor</hi> went out, to get as much of the <hi>Wrack,</hi> as they could, not caring to <hi>ſave</hi> the Peoples <hi>Lives:</hi> And in ſome parts of the Country, they called <hi>Shipwracks, God's Grace.</hi> Theſe things troubled me, and grieved my Spirit, to hear of ſuch unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Actions, conſidering, how far they were below the <hi>Heathen</hi> at <hi>Melita,</hi> who received <hi>Paul,</hi> and made him a <hi>Fire,</hi> and were courteous towards him, and them, that had ſuffered <hi>Shipwrack</hi> with him.

               <note place="margin">1660. Briſtol.</note>I came into <hi>Briſtol</hi> on the <hi>Seventh Day</hi> of the Week, and the Day before, the <hi>Souldiers</hi> came with their <hi>Muskets</hi> into the <hi>Meeting,</hi> and were exceeding rude, <hi>beating</hi> and <hi>ſtriking Friends</hi> with their <hi>Muskets,</hi> and drove them out of the <hi>Orchard</hi> in a great Rage, threatning, what they would do, if <hi>Friends</hi> came there again. For the <hi>Mayor</hi> and the <hi>Commander</hi> of the <hi>Souldiers</hi> had (it ſeems) combined together to make a Diſturbance amongſt <hi>Friends.</hi> Now when I came to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and <hi>Friends</hi> told me, what a Rage there was in the <hi>Town,</hi> how they were threatned by both the <hi>Mayor</hi> and <hi>Souldiers,</hi> and how unruly the <hi>Souldiers</hi> had been to <hi>Friends</hi> the day before; I ſent for ſeveral <hi>Friends,</hi> as <hi>George Biſhop, Thomas Gouldney, Thomas Speed</hi> and <hi>Edward Pyot,</hi> and deſired them, to go to the <hi>Mayor</hi> and <hi>Aldermen,</hi> and deſire them, ſeeing he and they had broke up our <hi>Meetings,</hi> to let <hi>Friends</hi> have the <hi>Town-Hall</hi> to <hi>Meet</hi> in; and for the uſe of it <hi>Friends</hi> would give them <hi>Twenty Pounds</hi> a <hi>Year,</hi> to be diſtributed amongſt the <hi>Poor:</hi> and when the <hi>Mayor</hi> and <hi>Aldermen</hi> had buſineſs to do in it, <hi>Friends</hi> would not <hi>Meet</hi> in it, but only on the <hi>Firſt Days.</hi> Thoſe <hi>Friends</hi> were aſtoniſhed at this, and ſaid, The <hi>Mayor</hi> and <hi>Aldermen</hi> would think, that they were <hi>Mad:</hi> But I ſaid, <hi>Nay;</hi> for they ſhould offer them a conſiderable <hi>Benefit</hi> to the <hi>Poor.</hi> And it was upon me from the <hi>Lord</hi> to bid them <hi>Go;</hi> and at laſt they Conſented, and <hi>went,</hi> though in the <hi>Croſs</hi> to their own Wills. When they had laid the thing before the <hi>Mayor,</hi> it came ſo over him, that he ſaid, <hi>For his part, he could conſent to it; but he was but one:</hi> And he told <hi>Friends</hi> of another <hi>Great Hall</hi> they might have; but that they did not accept of, it being inconvenient: So <hi>Friends</hi> came away, leaving the <hi>Mayor</hi> in a very loving <hi>Frame</hi> towards them: For they felt, the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> had come over him. When they came back, I ſpake to them to go alſo to the <hi>Colonel,</hi> that Commanded the <hi>Souldiers,</hi> and lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him the rude Carriage of his <hi>Souldiers,</hi> how they came <hi>Armed</hi> amongſt <hi>naked innnocent People, who were waiting upon, and worſhipping the Lord:</hi> But they were backward to go to him. Next Morning, being the <hi>Firſt Day</hi> of the Week, we went to the <hi>Meeting</hi> in the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard,</hi> where the <hi>Souldiers</hi> had ſo lately been ſo rude. And after I had declared the <hi>Truth</hi> a pretty while in the <hi>Meeting,</hi> there came in many <hi>rude Souldiers</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> ſome with <hi>Drawn Swords.</hi> The <hi>In-keepers</hi> had made ſome of them <hi>drunk;</hi> and one of them had bound himſelf with an <hi>Oath, to cut down and kill the Man that ſpoke.</hi> So he came preſſing in, through all the Crowd of People, to within <hi>two Yards</hi> of me, and ſtopt at thoſe <hi>Four Friends</hi> before-mentioned, (who ſhould have gone to the <hi>Colonel,</hi> as I would have had them) and fell a <hi>jangling</hi> with them. On a ſudden I ſaw, his <hi>Sword was put up</hi> and gone: For the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> came over all, and chained him and the reſt, and we had a bleſſed <hi>Meeting,</hi> and the <hi>Lord's</hi> Everlaſting Power and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence was felt amongſt us. On the Day following, thoſe <hi>Four Friends</hi> went and ſpake with the <hi>Colonel,</hi> and he ſent for the <hi>Souldiers,</hi> and <hi>Cut</hi> and <hi>Slaſht</hi> ſome of them before the <hi>Friends</hi> Faces. Which when I heard of, I blamed the <hi>Friends</hi> for letting him do ſo; and alſo for that they did not go on the <hi>Seventh Day,</hi> as I would have had them, which might have prevented this <hi>Cutting</hi> of the <hi>Souldiers,</hi> and the <hi>Trouble</hi> they gave at our <hi>Meeting.</hi> But thus the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> came

            <p>I had then alſo a <hi>General Meeting</hi> at <hi>Edw. Pyot</hi>'s near <hi>Briſtol,</hi> at which it was judged, there were divers <hi>Thouſands</hi> of People: For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <hi>Friends</hi> from many parts thereabouts, ſome of the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> and <hi>Independents,</hi> with their <hi>Teachers,</hi> came to it, and very many of the <hi>ſober People</hi> of <hi>Briſtol;</hi> inſomuch that the <hi>People,</hi> that ſtaid behind, ſaid, <hi>The City looked naked,</hi> there were ſo many gone out of it to this <hi>Meeting.</hi> It was a very quiet <hi>Meeting,</hi> and many glorious <hi>Truths</hi> were opened to the People, and the <hi>Lord Jeſus Christ</hi> was ſet up, who was the <hi>End</hi> of all <hi>Figures</hi> and <hi>Shadows,</hi> and the <hi>Law,</hi> and the <hi>firſt Covenant.</hi> And it was declared to the People, how that all <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures</hi> and <hi>Shadows</hi> were given to Man, after Man <hi>fell;</hi> and how that all the <hi>Rudiments</hi> and <hi>Inventions</hi> of Men, which have been ſet up in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> many of which were <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Heatheniſh Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi> were not ſet up by the <hi>Command</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and all <hi>Images</hi> and <hi>Likeneſſes</hi> Man has made to himſelf, or for himſelf, whether of things in <hi>Heaven</hi> or things in <hi>Earth,</hi> have been, ſince he loſt the <hi>Image</hi> and <hi>Likeneſs</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which <hi>God</hi> made him in. But now <hi>Chriſt</hi> was come to Redeem, Tranſlate, Convert and Regenerate <hi>Man</hi> out of all theſe things, that he hath ſet up in the <hi>Fall,</hi> and out of the true <hi>Types, Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures</hi> and <hi>Shadows</hi> alſo, and out of Death and Darkneſs, up into the Light, and Life, and Image and Likeneſs of God again, which Man and Woman were in, before they fell. Therefore all now ſhould come, and all might come to receive <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> the Subſtance, by his <hi>Light, Spirit, Grace</hi> and <hi>Faith;</hi> and ſhould live and walk in him, the Redeemer and Saviour.</p>
            <p>And whereas we had had a great deal of work with the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Profeſſors,</hi> who pleaded for <hi>Imperfection:</hi> I was opened to declare and manifeſt unto them, how that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were <hi>perfect,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they fell; and all that God made, he ſaw that it was good, and he bleſſed it. But the <hi>Imperfection</hi> came in by the <hi>Fall,</hi> through Man's and Woman's hearkening to the <hi>Devil,</hi> who was out of <hi>Truth.</hi> And though the <hi>Law</hi> made nothing <hi>perfect,</hi> yet it made way for the bringing in of the better Hope; which <hi>Hope</hi> is <hi>Christ,</hi> who deſtroys the <hi>Devil</hi> and his Works, that made Man and Woman <hi>Imperfect.</hi> Now <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith to his Diſciples, <hi>Be ye perfect, even as your Heavenly Father is perfect:</hi> And he, who himſelf was <hi>perfect,</hi> comes to make Man and Woman <hi>perfect</hi> again, and brings them again to the State, which God made them in. So he is the Maker up of the <hi>Breach,</hi> and the <hi>Peace</hi> betwixt <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man.</hi> That this might the better be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by the loweſt Capacities, I uſed a <hi>Compariſon</hi> of <hi>Two Old People,</hi> that had their <hi>Houſe</hi> broken down by an <hi>Enemy,</hi> ſo that they, with all their Children, were liable to all <hi>Storms</hi> and <hi>Tempests.</hi> And there came ſome to them, that pretended to be <hi>Workmen,</hi> and offered to build up their <hi>Houſe</hi> again, if they would give them <hi>ſo much a Year:</hi> But when they had gotten their <hi>Money,</hi> they left their <hi>Houſe,</hi> as they found it. After this manner came a <hi>Firſt, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth</hi> and <hi>Sixth,</hi> each with his ſeveral pretence, to build up the <hi>Old Houſe,</hi> and each got the Peoples <hi>Money;</hi> and then cried, <hi>They could not rear up the Houſe, nor the Breach could not be made up:</hi> For there
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:51448:197"/> is <hi>no Perfection here.</hi> Cry they; the <hi>Houſe</hi> can never be <hi>perfectly</hi> built up again in this <hi>Life:</hi> Though they have taken the Peoples <hi>Money</hi> for the doing of it. For all the <hi>Sects</hi> in <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> (ſo called) have pretended to build up <hi>Adam</hi>'s and <hi>Eve</hi>'s <hi>fallen Houſe;</hi> and when they have got Peoples <hi>Money,</hi> they tell them, the Work cannot be <hi>perfectly</hi> done here; and ſo their <hi>Houſe</hi> lies, as it did. But I told the People, Chriſt was come to do it <hi>freely,</hi> who, by one <hi>Offering,</hi> hath <hi>perfected</hi> for ever all them that are ſanctified, and renews them up into the <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which Man and Woman were in, before they fell, and makes Man's and Woman's <hi>Houſe</hi> as <hi>perfect</hi> again, as <hi>God</hi> had made them at the <hi>firſt:</hi> And this <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Heavenly Man, has done <hi>freely.</hi> Therefore all are to look unto him, and all that have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him, are to walk in him, the <hi>Life,</hi> the <hi>Subſtance,</hi> the <hi>Firſt</hi> and the <hi>Laſt, The Rock of Ages, and Foundation of many Generations.</hi> Largely were theſe, and many other things opened and declared unto the People, and the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> was Preached, which doth live and abide; and all were Exhorted to hear and obey that, which did live and abide, that by it all might be born again of the Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Seed, and feed of the <hi>Milk</hi> of the <hi>Word.</hi> A glorious <hi>Meeting</hi> there was, wherein the <hi>Lord</hi>'s Everlaſting Seed, <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> was ſet over all, and <hi>Friends</hi> parted in the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> in <hi>Peace,</hi> and in his <hi>Truth,</hi> that is over all.</p>

I had a ſenſe of the thing before-hand; and being in the <hi>Parlour</hi> with <hi>Richard Richardſon</hi> and <hi>Margaret Fell,</hi> ſome of her <hi>Servants</hi> came, and told her, that there were ſome come to ſearch the Houſe for <hi>Arms:</hi> and they went up into ſome of the Chambers under that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. It came upon me to go out to them; and as I was going by ſome of them, I ſpake ſome Words to them: whereupon they asked me my Name.<note place="margin">G.F. <hi>taken</hi> Priſoner.</note> I readily told them my Name: and then they laid hold on me, ſaying, I was the Man they looked for; and led me away to <hi>

               <note place="margin">Ulverſtone</note> There they kept me all Night, at the <hi>Constables</hi> Houſe, and ſet a <hi>Guard</hi> of <hi>Fifteen</hi> or <hi>Sixteen Men</hi> to watch me; ſome of whom ſate in the <hi>Chimney,</hi> for fear I ſhould go up the <hi>Chimney:</hi> ſuch <hi>dark Imaginations</hi> poſſeſſed them. They were very <hi>Rude</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncivil</hi> to me, and would neither ſuffer me to ſpeak to <hi>Friends,</hi> nor ſuffer <hi>Friends</hi> to bring me <hi>Neceſſaries;</hi> but with Violence thruſt out <hi>Friends,</hi> and kept a ſtrong <hi>Guard</hi> upon me. Very <hi>Wicked</hi> and <hi>Rude</hi> they were, and a great Noiſe they made about me. One of the <hi>Conſtables,</hi> whoſe Name was <hi>Askburnham,</hi> ſaid, <hi>He did not think, a Thouſand Men could have taken me.</hi> Another of the <hi>Conſtables,</hi> whoſe Name was <hi>Mount,</hi> a very wicked Man, ſaid, <hi>He would have ſerved Judge</hi> Fell <hi>himſelf ſo, if he had been alive, and he had a</hi> Warrant <hi>for him.</hi> Next Morning, about the <hi>Sixth Hour,</hi> I was putting on my <hi>Boots</hi> and <hi>Spurs,</hi> to go with them before ſome <hi>Juſtice;</hi> but they pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led off my <hi>Spurs,</hi> and took my <hi>Knife</hi> out of my Pocket, and ſo haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned me away along the <hi>Town,</hi> with a <hi>Party</hi> of <hi>Horſe,</hi> and abundance of <hi>People;</hi> not ſuffering me to ſtay, till my own <hi>Horſe</hi> came down. When I was gone about a <hi>quarter</hi> of a <hi>Mile</hi> with them, ſome <hi>Friends,</hi> with <hi>Margaret Fell</hi> and her <hi>Children</hi> came towards me; and then a great <hi>Party</hi> of <hi>Horſe</hi> gathered about me in a mad Rage and Fury, crying out, <hi>Will they reſcue him! Will they reſcue him!</hi> Whereupon I ſaid unto them, <hi>Here is my Hair, here is my Back, here are my Cheeks, strike on!</hi> With which Words their Heat was a little aſſwaged. Then
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:51448:199"/> they brought a <hi>little Horſe,</hi> and <hi>two</hi> of them took up one of my Legs,<note place="margin">1660.

When they were come a pretty way out of the <hi>Town,</hi> they beat the little <hi>Horſe,</hi> and made him kick and gallop: Whereupon I ſlipped off him, and told them, They ſhould not abuſe the Creature. They were much enraged at my getting off, and took me by the Legs and Feet, and ſet me upon the ſame <hi>Horſe,</hi> behind the Saddle again; and ſo led the <hi>Horſe</hi> on, about <hi>two Miles,</hi> till they came to a great Water, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Carter-Ford.</hi> By this time my own <hi>Horſe</hi> was come to us,<note place="margin">Carterford</note> and the <hi>Water</hi> being deep, and their little <hi>Horſe</hi> ſcarce able to have carried me through, they let me get upon my own <hi>Horſe,</hi> through the Perſwaſion of ſome of their own Company; they leading him through the Water. There was one Wicked Fellow <hi>kneeled down,</hi> and <hi>lifting up his Hands, bleſſed God, that I was taken.</hi> When I was come over the <hi>Sands,</hi> I told them, I had heard, I had liberty to chooſe, what <hi>Justice</hi> I would go before: But <hi>Mount,</hi> and the other <hi>Constables</hi> cry'd <hi>No, I ſhould not.</hi> Then they led me on to <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> about <hi>Fourteen Miles,</hi> and a great <hi>Triumph</hi> they thought to have had: but as they led me, I was moved to <hi>ſing Praiſes to the Lord, in his triumphing Power over all.</hi> When I was come to <hi>Lancaster,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lancaſter.</note> the Spirits of the People being mightily up, I ſtood and looked earneſtly upon them; and they cried, <hi>Look at his Eyes!</hi> After a while I ſpake to them; and then they were pretty ſober. Then came a <hi>Young Man,</hi> and had me to his Houſe: and after a little time the <hi>Officers</hi> had me to <hi>Major Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Houſe, who was called a <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and who had ſent forth the <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant</hi> againſt me; and he had ſeveral others with him. When I came in, I ſaid; <hi>Peace be amongſt you.</hi> Then <hi>Porter</hi> asked me, <hi>Why I came down into the Country that troubleſome time?</hi> I told him, To viſit my Brethren. <hi>But,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>you have great Meetings up and down.</hi> I told him, Though we had ſo, our <hi>Meetings</hi> were known throughout the Nation to be <hi>peaceable,</hi> and we were a <hi>peaceable People.</hi> He ſaid, <hi>We ſaw the Devil in Peoples Faces.</hi> I told him, If I ſaw a <hi>Drunkard,</hi> or a <hi>Swearer,</hi> or a <hi>peeviſh heady Man,</hi> I could not ſay, I ſaw the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in him. And I asked him, <hi>If he could ſee the Spirit of God?</hi> He ſaid, <hi>We cry'd againſt their Miniſters.</hi> I told him, While we were as <hi>Saul,</hi> ſitting under the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and running up and down with their <hi>Packets</hi> of <hi>Letters,</hi> we were never called <hi>Peſtilent Fellows,</hi> nor <hi>Makers</hi> of <hi>Sects;</hi> but when we were come to exerciſe our <hi>Conſciences</hi> towards <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> then we were called <hi>Peſtilent Fellows,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> was. He ſaid, We could Expreſs our ſelves well enough; and he would not <hi>Diſpute</hi> with me: but he would reſtrain me. I deſlred to know, <hi>for what, and by whoſe Order he ſent forth his</hi> Warrant <hi>for me?</hi> And I complained to him of the <hi>Abuſe</hi> of the <hi>Conſtables,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Officers</hi> to me, after they had taken me, and in their bringing me thither. He would not take notice of that, but told me, <hi>He had an Order, but would not let me ſee it; for he would not reveal the</hi> King's <hi>Secrets,</hi> he ſaid: And beſides, <hi>A Priſoner</hi> (he ſaid) <hi>was not to ſee, for what he was Committed.</hi> I told him, That was not Reaſon: For how ſhould he make his <hi>Defence</hi> then? I ſaid, I ought to have a <hi>Copy</hi> of
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:51448:200"/> it.<note place="margin">1660. Lancaſter.</note> But he ſaid, there was a <hi>Judge</hi> once, <hi>that fined one, for letting a Priſoner have a Copy of his Mittimus: And,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I have an Old Clerk, though I am a young Justice.</hi> Then he called to his <hi>Clerk,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Is it not ready yet? Bring it;</hi> meaning the <hi>Mittimus:</hi> But it not being ready, he told me, I was a <hi>Diſturber</hi> of the <hi>Nation.</hi> I told him, I had been a <hi>Bleſſing</hi> to the <hi>Nation,</hi> in and through the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> and <hi>Truth;</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in all <hi>Conſciences</hi> would anſwer it. Then he charged me to be an <hi>Enemy to the King, that I endeavoured to raiſe a new War, and imbrue the Nation in Blood again.</hi> I told him, I had never learned the <hi>Postures</hi> of <hi>War;</hi> but was Clear and Innocent, as a Child, concerning thoſe things; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was bold. Then came the <hi>Clerk</hi> with the <hi>Mittimus,</hi> and the <hi>Goa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi> was ſent for, and commanded to take me, and put me into the <hi>Dark-Houſe;</hi> and to let none come at me, but to keep me there a <hi>Cloſe Priſoner,</hi> until I ſhould be delivered by the <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Parliament.</hi> Then the <hi>Justice</hi> asked the <hi>Conſtables,</hi> where my <hi>Horſe</hi> was? <hi>For I hear,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>that he hath a good Horſe; have ye brought his Horſe?</hi> I told him, where my <hi>Horſe</hi> was; but he did not meddle with him. As they had me to the <hi>Jail,</hi> the <hi>Constable</hi> gave me my <hi>Knife</hi> again; and then asked me, to give it him: But I told him, <hi>Nay;</hi> he had not been ſo civil to me. So they put me into the <hi>Jail,</hi> and the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-Goaler, one <hi>Hardy,</hi> a very wicked Man, was exceeding <hi>Rude</hi> and <hi>Cruel,</hi> and many times would not let me have <hi>Meat</hi> brought in; but as I could get it <hi>under the Door.</hi> Many of the <hi>World's People</hi> came to look at me; ſome in great Rage, and very uncivil and rude. One time there came <hi>Two Young Prieſts,</hi> and very abuſive and rude they were; the <hi>worst of People</hi> could not be <hi>worſe.</hi> Amongſt thoſe that came in this manner, old <hi>Preston</hi> of <hi>Howker</hi> his <hi>Wife</hi> was one; and ſhe uſed many abuſive Words to me, telling me, my <hi>Tongue ſhould be cut out,</hi> and that <hi>I ſhould he hanged;</hi> ſhewing me the <hi>Gallows.</hi> But the Lord God <hi>Cut her off,</hi> and ſhe <hi>died</hi> in a miſerable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>

               <note place="margin">Lancaſter Jail.</note>Being now a <hi>Cloſe Priſoner</hi> in the <hi>Common Jail</hi> at <hi>Lancaster,</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired <hi>Two Friends, Thomas Cummings</hi> and <hi>Tho.

They went; and the <hi>Goaler</hi> anſwered them, <hi>He could not give a Copy of it; for another had been Fined for ſo doing:</hi> but he gave them liberty to read it over. And to the beſt of their remembrance, the Matters therein charged againſt me, were, <hi>That I was a Perſon generally ſuſpected to be a common Diſturber of the Peace of the Nation, an Enemy to the King, and a chief <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pholder of the</hi> Quakers <hi>Sect: And that I, together with others of my Fanatick Opinion, have of late endeavoured to raiſe Inſurrections in theſe parts of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and to imbroil the whole Kingdom in Blood.

            <p>When I had thus gotten the <hi>Heads</hi> of the <hi>Charge,</hi> contained in the <hi>Mittimus,</hi> by which I ſtood committed, I writ a plain, down-right <hi>Anſwer,</hi> in <hi>Vindication</hi> of my <hi>Innocency,</hi> to each Particular, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth:

As that I am <hi>generally ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be a common Disturber of the Nations Peace, an Enemy to the King and that I with others ſhould endeavour to raiſe Inſurrections, to imbroil the Nation in Blood.</hi> All which is utterly falſe; and I do, in every part thereof, deny it. For I am not a Perſon generally ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to be a <hi>Diſturber</hi> of the <hi>Nations Peace;</hi> nor have given any Cauſe for any ſuch <hi>Suſpicion:</hi> For through the <hi>Nation</hi> I have been tried of theſe things formerly.

Yet I was then carried up <hi>Priſoner</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> and kept <hi>Priſoner,</hi> till I was brought before him; and then I cleared my ſelf, and denied the drawing of a <hi>Carnal Weapon</hi> againſt him, or any Man upon the Earth: For my <hi>Weapons</hi> are <hi>Spiritual,</hi> which take away the occaſion of <hi>War,</hi> and lead into <hi>Peace:</hi> And upon my declaring this to <hi>Oliver,</hi> I was ſet at liberty by him. After this I was taken, and ſent to <hi>Priſon</hi> by <hi>Major Ceely</hi> in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> who, when I was brought before the <hi>Judge,</hi> informed againſt me, <hi>That I took him aſide, and told him, that I could raiſe Forty Thouſand Men in an hours time, to involve the Nation in Blood, and bring in King</hi> Charles. This alſo was utterly falſe, and a <hi>Lie</hi> of his own inventing; as was then proved upon him: For I never ſpake any ſuch Word to him.

For the <hi>Peace</hi> of the <hi>Nation</hi> I am not a <hi>Diſturber</hi> of, nor ever was; but ſeek the <hi>Peace</hi> of it, and of all Men, and ſtand for all <hi>Nations Peace,</hi> and <hi>all Men's Peace</hi> upon the Earth; and wiſh, that all Nations, and Men knew my <hi>Innocency</hi> in theſe things.</p>
                           <p>And whereas <hi>Major Porter</hi> ſaith, I am an <hi>Enemy to the King;</hi> this is falſe: For my <hi>Love</hi> is to <hi>him, and to all Men;</hi> though they be <hi>Enemies</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> to <hi>themſelves,</hi> and to <hi>me.</hi> And I can ſay, It is of the <hi>Lord,</hi> that he is come in, to bring down many unrighteouſly ſet up; of which I had a <hi>Sight Three Years</hi> before he came in. It is much, he ſhould ſay, I am an <hi>Enemy</hi> to the <hi>King;</hi> for I have no reaſon ſo to be, he having done nothing againſt me. But I have been often <hi>Impriſoned</hi> and <hi>Perſecuted</hi> theſe <hi>Eleven</hi> or <hi>Twelve Years,</hi> by them that have been againſt both the <hi>King,</hi> and his <hi>Father;</hi> even the <hi>Party,</hi> that <hi>Porter</hi> was made a <hi>Major</hi> by, and bore <hi>Arms</hi> for: but not by them, that were for the <hi>King.</hi> I was never an Enemy to the <hi>King,</hi> nor to any Man's Perſon upon the Earth; but I am in the <hi>Love,</hi> that fulfils the <hi>Law,</hi> which thinks no <hi>Evil,</hi> but <hi>loves</hi> even <hi>Enemies;</hi> and would have the <hi>King</hi> ſaved, and come to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the <hi>Truth,</hi> and be brought into the <hi>Fear</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his <hi>Wiſdom</hi> from above, by which all things were made and

The <hi>Poſtures</hi> of <hi>War</hi> I never learned: My <hi>Weapons</hi> are <hi>Spiritual</hi> and not <hi>Carnal;</hi> for with <hi>Carnal Weapons</hi> I do not fight: I am a Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of him, who ſaid, <hi>My Kingdom is not of this World.</hi> And though theſe <hi>Lies</hi> and <hi>Slanders</hi> are raiſed upon me, I deny drawing of any <hi>Carnal Weapon</hi> againſt the <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Parliament,</hi> or any Man upon the Earth: For I am come to the end of the Law, <hi>To love Enemies,</hi> and <hi>wreſtle not with Fleſh and Blood;</hi> but am in that, which ſaves Men's <hi>Lives:</hi> And a Witneſs I am againſt all <hi>Murderers, Plotters,</hi> and all ſuch as would <hi>Imbrue the Nation in Blood;</hi> for it is not in my Heart to have any Man's <hi>Life</hi> deſtroyed. And as for the Word <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>furious, fooliſh, mad,</hi> &amp;c. He might have conſidered himſelf, before he had uſed that Word; and have learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Humility,</hi> which goes before the <hi>Honour:</hi> For we are not <hi>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, fooliſh</hi> or <hi>Mad;</hi> but through <hi>Patience</hi> and <hi>Meekneſs</hi> have born <hi>Lies</hi> and <hi>Slanders,</hi> and <hi>Perſecutions</hi> many Years, and undergone great Sufferings.

                  </head>
                  <p>I Do Inform the <hi>Governours</hi> of this <hi>Nation,</hi> that <hi>Henry Porter, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor</hi> of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> ſent a <hi>Warrant</hi> with <hi>Four Conſtables</hi> to my Houſe, for which he had no <hi>Authority,</hi> nor <hi>Order.</hi> They ſearched my Houſe, and apprehended <hi>George Fox</hi> in it; who was not guilty of the <hi>Breach</hi> of any <hi>Law,</hi> or of any <hi>Offence</hi> againſt any in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

And every thing that was there charged againſt him, was utterly falſe; he was not guilty of any one <hi>Charge</hi> in it; as will be proved, and manifeſted to the Nation. So, let the <hi>Governours</hi> conſider of it. I am concerned in this thing, inaſmuch as he was apprehended in my <hi>Houſe;</hi> and if he be guilty, I am ſo too.

            <p>After this, <hi>Margaret Fell</hi> determined to go to <hi>London,</hi> to ſpeak with the <hi>King</hi> about my being taken; and to ſhew him the manner of it, and the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt Dealing</hi> and <hi>Evil <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage</hi> I had received. Which when <hi>Juſtice Porter</hi> heard of, he vapoured, that he would go, and meet her in the Gap. But when he came before the <hi>King,</hi> he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been a <hi>Zealous Man</hi> for the <hi>Parliament</hi> againſt the <hi>King,</hi> ſeveral of the <hi>Courtiers</hi> ſpake to him concerning his <hi>plundering</hi> of their <hi>Houſes:</hi>
               <pb n="222" facs="tcp:51448:202"/> So that he had quickly enough of the <hi>Court,</hi> and ſoon returned into the <hi>Country.</hi> Mean while the <hi>Jailer</hi> ſeemed very <hi>fearful,</hi> and ſaid, he was afraid, <hi>Major Porter would hang him, becauſe he had not put me in the Dark-Houſe,</hi> But when the <hi>Jailer</hi> went to wait on him, after he was come back from <hi>London,</hi> he was very <hi>blank</hi> and <hi>down;</hi> and asked, <hi>how I did?</hi> pretending, that he would find a way to ſet me at Liberty. But having overſhot himſelf in his <hi>Mittimus,</hi> by order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me <hi>to be kept Priſoner, till I ſhould be delivered by the</hi> King <hi>or</hi> Parliament, he had put it out of his Power to <hi>Releaſe</hi> me, if he would. He was the more down alſo, upon reading a <hi>Letter,</hi> which I ſent him. For when he was in the height of his <hi>Rage</hi> and <hi>Threats</hi> againſt me, and thought to ingratiate himſelf into the <hi>King's Favour,</hi> by <hi>Impriſoning</hi> me, I was moved to write to him, and put him in mind, <hi>How fierce he had been againſt the</hi> King <hi>and his Party, though now he would be thought zealous for the</hi> King. And among other Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in my <hi>Letter,</hi> I called to his remembrance, how, when he held <hi>Lancaſter-Caſtle</hi> for the <hi>Parliament,</hi> againſt the <hi>King,</hi> he was ſo rough and fierce againſt thoſe that favoured the <hi>King,</hi> that he ſaid, <hi>He would leave them neither Dog nor Cat, if they did not bring him in Proviſion to his Caſtle.</hi> I asked him alſo, <hi>Whoſe great</hi> Bucks-Horns <hi>thoſe were, that were in his Houſe? and where he had both them and the</hi> Wainſcot, <hi>that he Ceiled his Houſe withal? Had he them not from</hi> Hornby-Caſtle?</p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Ann Curtis</hi> of <hi>Reading</hi> came to ſee me: and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, how I ſtood Committed; it was upon her alſo to go to the <hi>King</hi> about it. For her <hi>Father,</hi> who had been <hi>Sheriff</hi> of <hi>Bristol,</hi> was <hi>hanged near his own Door,</hi> for <hi>endeavouring to bring the</hi> King <hi>in:</hi> Upon which Conſideration ſhe had ſome hopes, that the <hi>King</hi> might hear her on my behalf. Accordingly when ſhe returned to <hi>London,</hi> ſhe and <hi>Margaret Fell</hi> went to the <hi>King</hi> together: Who, when he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, whoſe <hi>Daughter</hi> ſhe was, received her kindly. And her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt to him being <hi>To ſend for me up, and hear the Cauſe himſelf;</hi> he promiſed her, he would: and commanded his <hi>Secretary</hi> to ſend down an <hi>Order,</hi> for the bringing me up. But when they came to the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary</hi> for the <hi>Order,</hi> he (being no Friend to us) ſaid, <hi>It was not in his Power; but that he muſt go according to</hi> Law, <hi>and I muſt be brought up by an</hi> Habeas Corpus <hi>before the Judges.</hi> So he writ to the <hi>Judge</hi> of the <hi>King's-Bench,</hi> ſignifying, That it was the <hi>King</hi>'s Pleaſure, that I ſhould be ſent for up by an <hi>Habeas Corpus.</hi> Accordingly a <hi>Writ</hi> was ſent down, and delivered to the <hi>Sheriff;</hi> but becauſe it was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the <hi>Chancellor</hi> of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> the <hi>Sheriff</hi> put it off to him: On the other hand, the <hi>Chancellor</hi> would not make the <hi>Warrant</hi> upon it; but ſaid, the <hi>Sheriff</hi> muſt do that. At length both <hi>Chancellor</hi> and <hi>Sheriff</hi> were got together: But being both <hi>Enemies</hi> to <hi>Truth,</hi> they ſought occaſion for <hi>Delay;</hi> and found (they ſaid) an <hi>Error</hi> in the <hi>Writ,</hi> which was, that being directed to the <hi>Chancellor,</hi> it ſaid, <hi>Geo. Fox in Priſon under YO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R Cuſtody;</hi> whereas the <hi>Priſon</hi> I was in, was not (they ſaid) in the <hi>Chancellor's Cuſtody,</hi> but in the <hi>Sheriff's:</hi> So the Word <hi>YO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R</hi> ſhould have been <hi>HIS.</hi> Upon this they Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the <hi>Writ</hi> to <hi>London</hi> again; only to have that one Word al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. When it was altered, and came down again, the <hi>Sheriff</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:51448:202"/> to carry me up; unleſs I would Seal a Writing to him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>bound,</hi> and pay for the <hi>Sealing,</hi> and the <hi>Charge of carrying me up:</hi> Which I denied; telling them, I would not <hi>Seal</hi> any thing to them, nor be <hi>Bound:</hi> So the matter reſted a while; and I continued in <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> Mean while the <hi>Aſſize</hi> came on: But inaſmuch as there was a <hi>Writ</hi> come down for removing me up, I was not brought before the <hi>Judge.</hi> At the <hi>Aſſize</hi> many People came to ſee me, and I was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ſpeak out at the <hi>Jail-Window</hi> to them, and ſhew them, <q>How uncertain their <hi>Religion</hi> was, and that every ſort that had been up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt, perſecuted the reſt. For when <hi>Popery</hi> was uppermoſt, Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had been perſecuted for not following the <hi>Maſs;</hi> and they that did hold up the <hi>Maſs,</hi> cried then, <hi>It was the Higher Power,</hi> and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple muſt be ſubject to the <hi>Higher Power.</hi> Afterwards, they that held up the <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> perſecuted others for not following that; and they ſaid, <hi>It was the Higher Power</hi> then alſo, <hi>and we must be ſubject to that.</hi> Since that, the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independents</hi> cried each of them, <hi>We muſt be ſubject to the Higher Power, and ſubmit to the Directory of the one, and the Church-Faith of the other.</hi> Thus all, like the <hi>Apoſtate-Jews,</hi> have cried, <hi>Help Men of</hi> Iſrael <hi>againſt the True Chriſtians:</hi> So People might ſee, how uncertain they are of their <hi>Religions.</hi> But I directed them to <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> that they might be built upon him, the <hi>Rock</hi> and <hi>Foundation</hi> that changeth not.</q> Much, on this wiſe, I declared to them, and they were quiet, and very attentive.

Nevertheleſs, I ſaid, If they would let me go up with <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two</hi> of my <hi>Friends,</hi> to bear me Company, I might go up, and be in <hi>London</hi> ſuch a Day, if the Lord did permit; and if they deſired it, <hi>I,</hi> or any of my <hi>Friends,</hi> that went with me, would carry up their <hi>Charge</hi> againſt my ſelf. So at laſt, when they ſaw, they could do no otherwiſe with me, the <hi>Sheriff</hi> yielded, and came under; conſenting, that <hi>I ſhould come up, with ſome of my</hi> Friends, <hi>without any other Engagement, than my Word,</hi> as aforeſaid, <hi>to appear before the</hi> Judges <hi>at</hi> London <hi>ſuch a day of the Term, if the Lord did permit.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Swarth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</note> Whereupon I was ſet out of <hi>Priſon,</hi> and went to <hi>Swarth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more;</hi> where I ſtay'd <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three days;</hi> and from thence went to <hi>Lancaſter</hi> again,<note place="margin">Lancaſter.

               </note> I came into <hi>Staffordſhire</hi> and <hi>Warwickſhire,</hi> till I came to <hi>Anthony Bickliff</hi>'s; and at <hi>Non-Eaton,</hi> at a <hi>Prieſt's Widow</hi>'s Houſe, we had a bleſſed <hi>Meeting,</hi> wherein the everlaſting <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> was pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully declared, and many ſettled in it.

               <note place="margin">London.</note> I came to <hi>London; Richard Huberthorn</hi> and <hi>Robert Withers</hi> being with me.</p>
            <p>When we came to <hi>Charing-Croſs,</hi> there were Multitudes of People gathered together, to ſee the <hi>Burning</hi> of the <hi>Bowels</hi> of ſome of them, that had been the <hi>Old King's Judges,</hi> and had been <hi>hanged, drawn</hi> and <hi>quartered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We went next Morning to <hi>Judge Mallet's Chamber,</hi> who was put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on his <hi>Red Gown,</hi> to go ſit upon ſome more of the <hi>King's Judges:</hi> He was then very peeviſh and froward; and ſaid, I might come ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time. We went another time to his <hi>Chamber,</hi> and then there was with him <hi>Judge Foſter,</hi> who was called the <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice</hi> of <hi>England:</hi> With me was one called <hi>Eſquire Marſh,</hi> who was one of the <hi>Bed-Chamber</hi> to the <hi>King.</hi> When we had delivered to the <hi>Judges</hi> the <hi>Charge,</hi> that was againſt me, and they had read to thoſe Words, <hi>That I and my Friends were Imbroiling the Nation in Blood,</hi> &amp;c. they ſtruck
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:51448:204"/> their Hands on the Table. Whereupon I told them,<note place="margin">1660. London.</note> 
               <hi>I was the Man, whom that Charge was againſt; but I was as Innocent of any ſuch thing, as a new-born Child, and had brought it up my ſelf: and ſome of my</hi> Friends <hi>came up with me without any Guard.</hi> As yet they had not minded my <hi>Hat;</hi> but now, ſeeing my <hi>Hat</hi> on, they ſaid, <hi>What, did I ſtand with my Hat on!</hi> I told them, I did not ſtand ſo in any <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt</hi> to them. Then they commanded one to take it off: And when they had called for the <hi>Marſhal</hi> of the <hi>King's-Bench,</hi> they ſaid to him; You muſt take this Man, and ſecure him: but you muſt let him have a <hi>Chamber,</hi> and not put him amongſt the <hi>Priſoners. My Lord,</hi> ſaid the <hi>Marſhal,</hi> I have no <hi>Chamber</hi> to put him into; my Houſe is ſo full, that I cannot tell where to provide a <hi>Room</hi> for him, but amongſt the <hi>Priſoners.</hi> Nay, ſaid the <hi>Judges,</hi> you muſt not put him amongſt the <hi>Priſoners.</hi> But when he ſtill anſwered, He had no other place to put me in; Judge <hi>Foſter</hi> ſaid to me, <hi>Will you appear to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row about</hi> Ten <hi>of the Clock, at the King's Bench-Bar in</hi> Weſtminſter-Hall? I ſaid, Yes, if the Lord give me Strength. Then ſaid <hi>Judge Foſter</hi> to the other <hi>Judge, If he ſay Yes, and promiſes it, you may take his Word:</hi> So I was diſmiſſed for that time. And next day I appeared at the <hi>King's Bench-Bar</hi> at the hour appointed, <hi>Robert Withers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">King's-Bench-Bar.</note> 
               <hi>Richard Huberthorn,</hi> and that <hi>Eſquire Marſh</hi> before named going with me. I was brought into the <hi>middle</hi> of the <hi>Court;</hi> and as ſoon as I was come in, I was moved to look about, and turning to the People, ſaid, <hi>Peace be among you;</hi> and the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> ſprang over the <hi>Court.</hi> The <hi>Charge</hi> againſt me was read openly: the People were moderate, and the <hi>Judges</hi> cool and loving; and the <hi>Lord's Mercy</hi> was to them. But when they came to that part of it, which ſaid, <hi>That I and my Friends were Imbroiling the Nation in Blood, and raiſing a new War; and that I was an Enemy to the King,</hi> &amp;c. they lifted up their hands. Then, ſtretching out my Arms, I ſaid, <q>I am the the Man, whom that <hi>Charge</hi> is againſt; but I am as <hi>Innocent,</hi> as a Child, concerning the <hi>Charge,</hi> and have never learned any <hi>War-Poſtures.</hi> And, ſaid I, do ye think, that if <hi>I</hi> and my <hi>Friends</hi> had been ſuch Men, as the <hi>Charge</hi> declares, that I would have Brought it up my ſelf againſt my ſelf? Or that I ſhould have beed ſuffered to come up with only <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two</hi> of my <hi>Friends</hi> with me? For had I been ſuch a Man, as this <hi>Charge</hi> ſets forth, I had need have been guarded up with a <hi>Troop</hi> or <hi>two</hi> of <hi>Horſe.</hi> But the <hi>Sheriff</hi> and <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> of <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> had thought fit to let <hi>me</hi> and my <hi>Friends</hi> come up with it our ſelves, almoſt <hi>two hundred Miles,</hi> without any <hi>Guard</hi> at all; which ye may be ſure, they would not have done, if they had looked upon me to be ſuch a Man.</q> Then the <hi>Judge</hi> asked me, Whether it ſhould be <hi>Filed?</hi> or what I would do with it? I anſwered, Ye are <hi>Judges,</hi> and able (I hope) to <hi>Judge</hi> in this matter: therefore do with it, what ye will: for I am the Man theſe <hi>Charges</hi> are againſt; and here ye ſee, I have brought them up my ſelf: Do ye what ye will with them, I leave it to you. Then <hi>Judge Twiſden</hi> beginning to ſpeak ſome angry Words, I appealed to <hi>Judge Foſter</hi> and <hi>Judge Mallet,</hi> who had heard me over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night. Whereupon they ſaid, They <hi>did not accuſe me, for tney had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt me.</hi> Then ſtood up he that was called <hi>Eſquire Marſh,</hi> who was of the <hi>King's Bed-Chamber,</hi> and told the <hi>Judges, It was the
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:51448:205"/> King's Pleaſure that I ſhould be ſet at Liberty, ſeeing no Accuſer came up againſt me.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1660. King's Bench-Bar.</note> Then they asked me, <hi>Whether I would put it to the King and Council.</hi> I ſaid, <hi>Yes, with a good Will.</hi> Thereupon they ſent the <hi>Sheriff's Return,</hi> which he made to the <hi>Writ</hi> of <hi>Habeas Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi> containing the matter charged againſt me in the <hi>Mittimus,</hi> to the <hi>King,</hi> that he might ſee, for what I was <hi>Committed.</hi> Now the <hi>Return</hi> of the <hi>Sheriff</hi> of <hi>Lancaster</hi> was thus:</p>

               <note place="margin">Whitehall.</note> They looked ſtrangely on me there; but I paſſed through them, and went to the <hi>Pell-Mell,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pell-mell.</note> whither divers <hi>Friends</hi> came to me, though it was now grown dangerous paſſing the Streets: For by this time both the <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Suburbs</hi> were up in <hi>Arms,</hi> and exceeding rude the <hi>People</hi> and <hi>Souldiers</hi> were; inſomuch that a <hi>Friend, Henry Fell,</hi> going to a <hi>Friends</hi> Houſe, the <hi>Soldiers</hi> knockt him down: and he had been <hi>killed,</hi> if the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>York</hi> had not come by.

The <hi>Maid</hi> let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them in, they ruſhed into the Houſe, and ſtrait laid hold upon me: and there being amongſt them one, that had ſerved under the <hi>Parliament,</hi> he clapt his Hand to my Pocket, and asked, <hi>Whether I had any Piſtols?</hi> I told him, He knew, I did not uſe to carry <hi>Piſtols;</hi> why therefore did he ask ſuch a Queſtion of me, whom he knew to be a <hi>Peaceable Man?</hi> Others of the <hi>Souldiers</hi> run up into the Chambers, and there found in Bed that <hi>Squire Marſh</hi> before mentioned; who, tho' he was one of the <hi>King's Bed-Chamber,</hi> out of his love to me, came, and lodged where I did. When they came down again, they ſaid, <hi>Why ſhould we take this Man away with us? We will let him alone.</hi> Oh, ſaid the <hi>Parliament-Souldier,</hi> he is one of the <hi>Heads,</hi> and a chief <hi>Ring-leader.</hi> Upon this the <hi>Souldiers</hi> were taking me away; but — <hi>Marſh</hi> hearing of it, he ſent for him that <hi>Commanded</hi> the <hi>Party,</hi> and deſired him to let me alone; for he would ſee me forth-coming in the Morning. In the <hi>Morning,</hi> before they could fetch me, and before the <hi>Meeting</hi> was gathered, there came a <hi>Company</hi> of <hi>Foot</hi> to the Houſe; and one of them drawing out his <hi>Sword,</hi> held it over my Head. I asked him, <hi>Wherefore he drew his Sword at a Naked Man?</hi> At which his Fellows being aſhamed, bid him, put up his <hi>Sword.</hi> Theſe <hi>Foot-Souldiers</hi> took me away to <hi>Whitehall,</hi>
               <note place="margin">G F. <hi>taken Priſoner.</hi> Whitehall.</note> before the <hi>Troopers</hi> came for me. As I was going out, ſeveral <hi>Friends</hi> were coming in to the <hi>Meeting,</hi> whoſe Boldneſs and Chearfulneſs I commended, and encouraged them to perſevere therein. When I was brought to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> the <hi>Soldiers</hi> and <hi>People</hi> were exceeding rude; yet I declared <hi>Truth</hi> to them: But ſome <hi>great Perſons</hi> coming by, who were very full of Envy, <hi>What,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>do ye let him Preach? Put him into ſuch a place, where he may not ſtir.</hi> So into that <hi>place</hi> they put me, and the <hi>Soldiers</hi> watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over me: I told them, Though they could confine my <hi>Body,</hi> and ſhut that up; yet they could not ſtop up the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Life.</hi> Some thereupon came, and asked me, <hi>What I was?</hi> I told them, I was a <hi>Preacher</hi> of <hi>Righteouſneſs.</hi> After I had been kept there <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three Hours, — Marſh</hi> ſpake to him, that was called the <hi>Lord Gerrard;</hi> and he came, and bid them ſet me at <hi>liberty.</hi> Then the <hi>Marſhal,</hi>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:51448:206"/> when I was diſcharged, demanded <hi>Fees.</hi> I told him,<note place="margin">1660. Whitehall.</note> I could not give him any; neither was it our Practice: And I asked him, How he could demand <hi>Fees</hi> of me, who was <hi>Innocent?</hi> Nevertheleſs, I told him, in my own Freedom I would give him <hi>Two Pence,</hi> to make him and the <hi>Souldiers</hi> drink: But they ſhouted at that, and took it diſdainfully. So I told them, If they would not accept it, chooſe they: for I ſhould give them no <hi>Fees.</hi> Then went I through the <hi>Guards,</hi> the <hi>Lord s Power</hi> being over them; and after I had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared <hi>Truth</hi> to the <hi>Guards</hi> and <hi>Souldiers,</hi> I went up the Streets with two <hi>Iriſh Colonels,</hi> that came from <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and went to an <hi>Inn,</hi> where many <hi>Friends</hi> were at that time <hi>Priſoners</hi> under a <hi>Guard.</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired thoſe <hi>Colonels</hi> to ſpeak to the <hi>Guard</hi> to let me go in, to viſit my <hi>Friends,</hi> that were <hi>Priſoners</hi> there: but they would not. Then I ſtept to the <hi>Centry,</hi> and deſired him to let me go up; and he did ſo. While I was there, the <hi>Souldiers</hi> went to the <hi>Pell-Mell</hi> again, to ſearch for me there: but not finding me, they turned towards the <hi>Inn,</hi> and bid all come out, that were not <hi>Priſoners;</hi> ſo they went out. But I asked the <hi>Souldiers,</hi> that were within, Whether I might not ſtay there a while with my <hi>Friends?</hi> And they ſaid, <hi>Yes.</hi> I ſtay'd a while, and ſo eſcaped their Hands again. Towards Night I went down to the <hi>Pell-Mell,</hi> to ſee, how it was with the <hi>Friends</hi> there; and after I had ſtay'd a while, I went up into the City.<note place="margin">London.</note> Great <hi>Rifling of Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> there was at this time, to ſearch for <hi>People:</hi> but I went to a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate <hi>Friend</hi>'s Houſe, and <hi>Richard Huberthorn</hi> was with me. There we drew up a <hi>Declaration</hi> againſt <hi>Plots</hi> and <hi>Fightings,</hi> to be preſented to the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Council:</hi> But when we had finiſhed it, and ſent it to the <hi>Preſs,</hi> it was taken in the <hi>Preſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this <hi>Inſurrection</hi> of the <hi>Fifth Monarchy-Men,</hi> great <hi>Havock</hi> was made both in <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Country,</hi> ſo that it was dangerous for ſober Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to ſtir abroad for ſeveral Weeks after; and hardly could either Men or Women go up and down the Streets to buy Proviſions for their Families, without being <hi>abuſed.</hi> In the <hi>Countries</hi> they drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Men and Women out of their Houſes, and ſome <hi>Sick Men</hi> out of their <hi>Beds</hi> by the Legs. Nay, one <hi>Man,</hi> that was in a <hi>Fever,</hi> the <hi>Souldiers</hi> dragged out of his Bed to <hi>Priſon;</hi> and when he was brought thither, he <hi>died.</hi> His Name was <hi>Thomas Pachyn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Margaret Fell</hi> went to the <hi>King,</hi> and told him, what ſad Work there was in the <hi>City,</hi> and in the <hi>Nation;</hi> and ſhewed him, that we were an <hi>Innocent, peaceable People,</hi> and that we muſt keep our <hi>Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> as we uſed to do, whatever we ſuffered: but that it concerned him to ſee, that <hi>Peace</hi> was kept, that ſo no <hi>Innocent Blood</hi> might be ſhed.</p>
            <p>Now were the <hi>Priſons</hi> every where filled with <hi>Friends,</hi> and others, in <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Country;</hi> and the <hi>Posts</hi> were ſo laid, for the ſearching of <hi>Letters,</hi> that none could paſs unſearched: Yet we heard of ſeveral <hi>Thouſands</hi> of our <hi>Friends,</hi> that were caſt into <hi>Priſon</hi> in ſeveral places throughout the Nation; and <hi>Margaret Fell</hi> carried an <hi>Account</hi> of them to the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Council.</hi> The next Week we had an Account of <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Thouſands</hi> more, that were caſt into <hi>Priſon:</hi> and ſhe went, and laid them alſo before the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>Council.</hi> They wondered, how we could have ſuch Intelligence, ſeeing they had given ſuch <hi>strict
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:51448:153"/> Charge</hi> for the intercepting of all <hi>Letters:</hi> But the <hi>Lord</hi> did ſo order it, that we had an <hi>Account,</hi> notwithſtanding all their Stoppings. For in the deep Senſe I had of the <hi>grievous Sufferings, Friends</hi> underwent, and of their <hi>Innocency</hi> towards God and Man, I was moved to ſend the following <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to them, as a <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Conſolation,</hi> and to put them upon ſending up their <hi>Sufferings.</hi>

                        <p>OUR <hi>Principle</hi> is, and our <hi>Practices</hi> have always been, to ſeek <hi>Peace,</hi> and enſue it, and to follow after Righteouſneſs, and the Knowledge of God; ſeeking the <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Welfare,</hi> and doing that which tends to the <hi>Peace</hi> of <hi>All.</hi> We know, that <hi>Wars</hi> and <hi>Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> proceed from the <hi>Luſts</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> as <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.1, 2, 3. out of which <hi>Luſts</hi> the Lord hath redeemed us; and ſo out of the <hi>Occaſion</hi> of <hi>War:</hi> the occaſion of which <hi>War,</hi> and the <hi>War</hi> itſelf (wherein envious Men, who are lovers of themſelves more than lovers of God, <hi>Luſt, Kill,</hi> and deſire to have Men's <hi>Lives</hi> or <hi>Eſtates</hi>) ariſeth from the <hi>Luſt.</hi> All <hi>Bloody Principles</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> We (as to our own particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar) do utterly deny; with all outward <hi>Wars</hi> and <hi>Strife,</hi> and <hi>Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> with Outward Weapons, for any end, or under any pretence whatſoever: and this is our Teſtimony to the whole World.</p>
                        <p>And whereas it is Objected:</p>
                        <p>But although you now ſay, <hi>That you cannot</hi> Fight, <hi>nor take up</hi> Arms <hi>at all; yet if the Spirit do move you, then you will change your Principle, and then you will ſell your Coat, and buy a</hi> Sword, <hi>and</hi> Fight <hi>for the Kingdom of Chriſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> As for this, we ſay to you, that Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Peter, Put up thy Sword in his place;</hi> though he had ſaid before, he that had no <hi>Sword,</hi> might ſell his Coat and buy one, (to the fulfilling of the Law and Scripture) yet after, when he had bid him put it up, he ſaid, <hi>He that taketh the Sword, ſhall periſh with the Sword.</hi> And further, Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Pilate, Thinkeſt thou, that I cannot now pray to my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and he ſhall preſently give me more than twelve Legions of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels?</hi> And this might ſatisfie <hi>Peter, Luke</hi> 22.36. after he had put up his <hi>Sword,</hi> when he ſaid to him, <hi>He that took it, ſhould periſh by it;</hi> which ſatisfieth us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.51, 52, 53. And in the <hi>Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> it's ſaid; <hi>He that kills with the</hi> Sword, <hi>ſhall periſh with the</hi> Sword; <hi>and here is the Faith and the Patience of the Saints.</hi> And ſo <hi>Chriſt's Kingdom</hi> is not of this World, therefore do not his Servants <hi>Fight;</hi> as he told <hi>Pilate</hi> the <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> who Crucified him: and did they not look upon Chriſt, as a <hi>Raiſer</hi> of <hi>Sedition?</hi> and did not he ſay, <hi>Forgive them?</hi> But thus it is, that we are numbred amongſt Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:51448:207"/> and numbred amongſt <hi>Fighters,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">1660. London.</note> that the Scriptures might be fulfilled.</p>
                        <p>That <hi>Spirit</hi> of Chriſt, by which we are guided, is not changeable, ſo as once to command us <hi>from</hi> a thing, as <hi>Evil,</hi> and again to move <hi>unto</hi> it; and we do certainly know, and ſo teſtifie to the World, That the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which leads us into all Truth, will never move us to <hi>Fight</hi> and <hi>War</hi> againſt any Man with outward Weapons, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> nor for the <hi>Kingdoms</hi> of this <hi>World.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of Chriſt <hi>God</hi> will exalt, according to his Promiſe, and cauſe it to grow and flouriſh in Righteouſneſs; <hi>Not by Might, nor by Power (of outward Sword) but by my Spirit, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Zech. 4.6. So thoſe that uſe any Weapon to <hi>Fight</hi> for Chriſt, or for the eſtabliſhing of his Kingdom or Government, both the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, Principle</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> in that, we deny.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> We do earneſtly deſire and wait, That (by the Word of God's Power, and its effectual Operation in the Hearts of Men) the <hi>Kingdoms</hi> of this <hi>World</hi> may become the <hi>Kingdoms</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and of his <hi>Christ;</hi> that he might Rule and Reign in Men by his <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Truth:</hi> that thereby all People out of all different Judgments and Profeſſions, might be brought into <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> with God, and one with another; and that they might all come to witneſs the Prophets Words, who ſaid, <hi>Nation ſhall not lift up</hi> Sword <hi>againſt Nation, neither ſhall they learn</hi> War <hi>any more,</hi> Iſa. 2.4. Mich. 4.3.</p>
                        <p>So we, whom the Lord hath called into the Obedience of his Truth, <hi>have denied Wars</hi> and <hi>Fightings,</hi> and cannot again any more learn it. And this is a certain Teſtimony unto all the World, of the Truth of our Hearts in this particular, that as <hi>God</hi> perſwadeth every Man's Heart to believe, ſo they may receive it. For we have not (as ſome others) gone about cunningly with deviſed Fables; nor have we ever denied in <hi>Practice,</hi> what we have profeſſed in <hi>Principle;</hi> but in Sincerity and Truth, and by the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God</hi> have we laboured to be made manifeſt unto all Men, that both we and our ways might be witneſſed in the Hearts of all People. And whereas all manner of <hi>Evil</hi> hath been falſly ſpoken of us, we hereby ſpeak forth the plain Truth of our Hearts, to take away the occaſion of that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: that ſo we being <hi>Innocent,</hi> may not ſuffer for other Men's <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences,</hi> nor be made a Prey upon by the Wills of Men for that, of which we were never Guilty; but in the Uprightneſs of our Hearts we may, under the <hi>Power</hi> ordained of <hi>God</hi> for the Puniſhment of Evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doers, and for the Praiſe of them that do well, live a <hi>peaceable</hi> and <hi>godly Life,</hi> in all Godlineſs and Honeſty. For although we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <hi>ſuffered,</hi> and do now more abundantly <hi>ſuffer;</hi> yet we know, that it's for <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> ſake: <hi>For our rejoycing is this, the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our Conſciences, that in Simplicity and godly Sincerity, not with fleſhly Wiſdom, but by the Grace of God we have had our Converſation in the World,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.12. Which for us is a Witneſs, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing of our Enemies. For this we can ſay to all the World, we have wronged no Man's <hi>Perſons</hi> or <hi>Poſſeſſions;</hi> we have uſed no <hi>Force</hi> nor <hi>Violence</hi> againſt any Man; we have been found in no <hi>Plots,</hi> nor guilty of <hi>Sedition;</hi> when we have been wronged, we have not ſought to revenge our ſelves; we have not made reſiſtance againſt Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:51448:207"/> but wherein we could not obey for Conſcience-ſake, we have <hi>ſuffered</hi> even the moſt of any People in the Nation. We have been counted as Sheep for the <hi>Slaughter, Perſecuted</hi> and <hi>Deſpiſed, Beaten, Stoned, Wounded, Stocked, Whipped, Impriſoned, Haled out</hi> of Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, caſt into <hi>Dungeons</hi> and <hi>Noiſom Vaults,</hi> where many have <hi>died in Bonds,</hi> ſhut up from our <hi>Friends,</hi> denied needful Suſtenance for many days together; with other the like Cruelties. And the Cauſe of all theſe our Sufferings is not for any <hi>Evil,</hi> but for things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the Worſhip of our God, and in obedience to his Requirings of us; <hi>For which Cauſe we ſhall freely give up our Bodies a Sacrifice, rather than diſobey the Lord:</hi> For we know, as the Lord hath kept us <hi>Innocent,</hi> ſo he will plead our Cauſe, when there is none in the Earth to plead it. So we, in Obedience unto his Truth, do not love our <hi>Lives</hi> unto <hi>Death,</hi> that we may do his <hi>Will,</hi> and wrong no Man in our Generation; but ſeek the Good and Peace of all Men. And he that hath commanded us, <hi>That we ſhall not</hi> Swear <hi>at all,</hi> Matth. 5.34. hath alſo commanded us, <hi>That we ſhall not</hi> Kill, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. So that we can neither <hi>Kill</hi> Men, nor <hi>Swear</hi> for, nor againſt them. And this is both our <hi>Principle</hi> and <hi>Practice,</hi> and hath been from the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; ſo that if we ſuffer, as <hi>ſuſpected to take up Arms,</hi> or <hi>make War</hi> againſt any, it is without any Ground from us: For it neither is, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> ever was in our Hearts, ſince we owned the <hi>Truth</hi> of God; neither ſhall we ever do it: becauſe it is contrary to the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> his Doctrine, and the <hi>Practices</hi> of his <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> even contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to him, for whom we <hi>ſuffer</hi> all things, and endure all things.</p>
                        <p>And whereas Men come againſt us with <hi>Clubs, Staves, Drawn Swords, Piſtols cock't,</hi> and do <hi>beat, cut</hi> and <hi>abuſe</hi> us; yet we never reſiſted them, but to them our <hi>Hair, Backs</hi> and <hi>Cheeks</hi> have been ready: But it is not an <hi>Honour</hi> to Manhoood or Nobility, to run up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on harmleſs People, who lift not up an Hand againſt them, with <hi>Arms</hi> and <hi>Weapons.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Therefore conſider theſe things, ye Men of Underſtanding: For <hi>Plotters, Raiſers</hi> of <hi>Inſurrections, Tumultuous</hi> Ones, and <hi>Fighters,</hi> running with <hi>Swords, Clubs, Staves</hi> and <hi>Piſtols</hi> one againſt another; we ſay, theſe are of the World, and have their Foundation from this Unrighteous World; from the Foundation of which, the <hi>Lamb</hi> hath been ſlain: which <hi>Lamb</hi> hath redeemed us from this unrighteous World, and we are not of it; but are <hi>Heirs</hi> of a <hi>World,</hi> in which there is no End; and of a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> where no corruptible thing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. And our Weapons are <hi>Spiritual,</hi> and not <hi>Carnal,</hi> yet <hi>Mighty through God, to the pulling down of the Strong Holds of</hi> Sin <hi>and Satan,</hi> who is Author of <hi>Wars, Fighting, Murder,</hi> and <hi>Plots;</hi> and our <hi>Swords</hi> are broken into <hi>Plow ſhares,</hi> and <hi>Spears</hi> into <hi>Pruning-hooks;</hi> as Propheſied of in <hi>Micah</hi> 4. Therefore we cannot learn <hi>War</hi> any more, neither riſe up againſt Nation or Kingdom with <hi>outward Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,</hi> tho' you have numbred us amongſt the Tranſgreſſors and Plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: the Lord knows our <hi>Innocency</hi> herein, and will plead our Cauſe with all Men and People upon Earth, at the day of their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when all Men ſhall have a Reward according to their Works.</p>
                        <pb n="236" facs="tcp:51448:208"/>
                        <p>Therefore in love we warn you for your Souls good, <hi>not to wrong the Innocent,</hi> nor the Babes of Chriſt, which he hath in his Hand, which he tenders as the Apple of his Eye; neither ſeek to deſtroy the Heritage of God, neither turn your Swords <hi>backward,</hi> upon ſuch as the <hi>Law</hi> was not made for, <hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>Righteous;</hi> but for the Sinners and Tranſgreſſors, to keep them down.

If you oppreſs us, as they did the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Egypt;</hi> and if you oppreſs us, as they did, when <hi>Christ</hi> was Born, and as they did the Chriſtians in the Primitive Times; we can ſay, <hi>The Lord forgive you:</hi> and leave the Lord to deal with you, and not revenge our ſelves.

                        <p>Oh <hi>Friends!</hi> Offend not the <hi>Lord</hi> and his <hi>Little Ones,</hi> neither af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict his <hi>People;</hi> but conſider, and be moderate. And do not run haſtily into things; but mind, and conſider <hi>Mercy, Justice</hi> and <hi>Judgment:</hi> that is the way for you to proſper, and get the Favour of the Lord. Our <hi>Meetings</hi> were ſtopped and broken up in the days of <hi>Oliver,</hi> in pretence of <hi>Plotting</hi> againſt him; and in the days of the <hi>Committee</hi> of <hi>Safety</hi> we were looked upon, as <hi>Plotters,</hi> to bring in KING <hi>CHARLES:</hi> and now our <hi>Peaceable Meetings</hi> are termed <hi>Seditious.</hi> Oh that Men ſhould loſe their Reaſon, and go contrary to their own Conſcience; knowing, that we have <hi>ſuffered</hi> all things, and have been accounted <hi>Plotters</hi> all along, though we have declared againſt them both by <hi>Word</hi> of Mouth, and <hi>Printing,</hi> and are clear from any ſuch thing! Though we have ſuffered all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, becauſe we would not take up Carnal <hi>Weapons</hi> to <hi>fight</hi> withal againſt any; and are thus made a Prey upon, becauſe we are the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Lambs of Chriſt, and cannot avenge our ſelves! Theſe things are left upon your Hearts to conſider: But we are out of all thoſe things, in the Patience of the Saints: and we know, that as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>He that takes the</hi> Sword, <hi>ſhall periſh with the</hi> Sword, <hi>Mat,</hi> 26.52. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.10.</p>

                        <p>THough we are numbred amongſt Tranſgreſſors, and ſo have been given up to all Rude, Mercileſs Men, by which our <hi>Meetings</hi> are broken up, in which we Edified one another in our Holy Faith, and prayed together to the Lord, that lives for ever; yet he is our Pleader for us in this Day. The Lord ſaith, <hi>They that feared his Name, ſpake often together,</hi> (as in <hi>Malachy</hi>) which were as his Jewels: And for this Cauſe, and no Evil-doing, are we caſt into <hi>Holes, Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, Houſes</hi> of <hi>Correction, Priſons,</hi> (they ſparing neither Old nor Young, Men nor Women) and made a Prey on in the ſight of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, under pretence of being <hi>Seditious,</hi> &amp;c. ſo that all rude People run upon us to take Poſſeſſion: For which we ſay, <hi>The Lord forgive them, that have thus done to us;</hi> who doth, and will enable us to ſuffer; and never ſhall we lift up hand againſt any Man, that doth thus uſe us: But that the Lord may have mercy upon them, that they may conſider, what they have done. For how is it poſſible for them, to requite us for the Wrong they have done to us? Who to all Nations have ſounded us abroad as <hi>Seditious,</hi> or <hi>Plotters,</hi> who were never found <hi>Plotters</hi> againſt any Power or Man upon the Earth, ſince we knew the <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> manifeſted <hi>in us,</hi> who hath redeemed us from the World, and all Works of Darkneſs, and <hi>Plotters</hi> that be in it; by which we know our Election, before the World began. So we ſay, The Lord have Mercy upon our Enemies, and forgive them, for that they have done unto us.</p>
                        <p>Oh! do as you would be done by; and do unto all Men, as you would have them do unto you; for this is but the Law and the Prophets.</p>
                        <p>And all <hi>Plots, Inſurrections</hi> and <hi>Riotous Meetings</hi> we do deny, knowing them to be of the <hi>Devil,</hi> the <hi>Murtherer;</hi> which we in Chriſt (who was before they were) Triumph over them. And all <hi>Wars</hi> and <hi>Fightings</hi> with Carnal Weapons we do deny, who have the <hi>Sword</hi> of the <hi>Spirit:</hi> and all that wrong us, we leave them to the Lord. And this is to clear our Innocency from that Aſperſion caſt upon us, <hi>That we are Seditious or Plotters.</hi>

            <p>This <hi>Declaration</hi> did ſomewhat clear the <hi>Dark Air,</hi> that was over the <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Country.</hi> And ſoon after the <hi>King</hi> gave forth a <hi>Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, That no Soldiers ſhould go to ſearch any Houſe, but with a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable.</hi> But the <hi>Jails</hi> were ſtill full, many <hi>Thouſands</hi> of <hi>Friends</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Priſon</hi> in the <hi>Nation:</hi> Which <hi>Miſchief</hi> was occaſioned by that wicked <hi>Riſing</hi> of thoſe <hi>Fifth-Monarchy-Men.</hi> But when thoſe of them, that were taken, came to be executed, they did us that Right, to <hi>clear us openly, from having any hand in, or knowledge of their Plot.</hi> And after that the <hi>King,</hi> being continually Importuned thereunto, Iſſued forth a <hi>Declaration, That</hi> Friends <hi>ſhould be ſet at liberty, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out paying Fees.</hi> But great Labour and Travel, Care and Pains was taken in it, before this was obtained; for <hi>Thomas Moor</hi> and <hi>Margaret Fell</hi> went often to the <hi>King</hi> about it.</p>
            <p>Much <hi>Blood</hi> was ſhed this Year; many of them, that had been the <hi>Old King's Judges,</hi> being <hi>hanged, drawn</hi> and <hi>quartered.</hi> And amongſt them, that ſo ſuffered, <hi>Col. Hacker</hi> was one; he who ſent me <hi>Priſoner</hi> from <hi>Leiceſter</hi> to <hi>London</hi> in <hi>Oliver's</hi> time: of which an Account is given be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. A <hi>ſad Day</hi> it was, and a <hi>Repaying</hi> of <hi>Blood</hi> with <hi>Blood.</hi> For in the time of <hi>O. Cromwel,</hi> when ſeveral Men were put to <hi>Death</hi> by him, being <hi>hanged, drawn</hi> and <hi>quartered</hi> for pretended <hi>Treaſons;</hi> I felt from the <hi>Lord God,</hi> that their <hi>Blood</hi> would not be put up, but would be <hi>required:</hi> And I ſaid as much then to ſeveral. And now, upon the <hi>King's Return,</hi> when ſeveral of them that had been againſt the <hi>King,</hi> were put to <hi>Death,</hi> as the others, that were for the <hi>King,</hi> had been before by <hi>Oliver:</hi> This was <hi>ſad Work,</hi> deſtroying of People contrary to the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who have the Nature of <hi>Lambs</hi> and <hi>Sheep.</hi> But there was a <hi>Secret Hand</hi> in bringing this <hi>Day</hi> upon that <hi>Hypocritical Generation</hi> of <hi>Profeſſors;</hi> who being got into <hi>Power,</hi> grew <hi>Proud, Haughty</hi> and <hi>Cruel</hi> beyond others, and <hi>perſecuted</hi> the <hi>People</hi> of <hi>God</hi> without pity. Therefore when <hi>Friends</hi> were under <hi>cruel Perſecutions</hi> and <hi>Sufferings</hi> in the <hi>Common-wealth's</hi> time, I was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the <hi>Lord</hi> to write unto <hi>Friends,</hi> to draw up their <hi>Sufferings,</hi> and lay them before the <hi>Juſtices</hi> at their <hi>Seſſions.</hi> And if they would not do them <hi>Juſtice,</hi> then to lay it before the <hi>Judges</hi> at the <hi>Aſſize:</hi> And if <hi>they</hi> would not do them <hi>Juſtice,</hi> then to lay it before the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> and before the <hi>Protector</hi> and his <hi>Council;</hi> that they might all ſee, what was done under their <hi>Government:</hi> And if <hi>they</hi> would not do <hi>Juſtice,</hi> then to lay it before the <hi>Lord;</hi> who would hear the <hi>Cries</hi> of the <hi>Oppreſſed,</hi> and of the <hi>Widows</hi> and <hi>Fatherleſs,</hi> that they had made ſo. For that which we <hi>ſuffered</hi> for, and which our <hi>Goods</hi> were <hi>ſpoiled</hi> for, it was for our <hi>Obedience</hi> to the <hi>Lord</hi> in his Power and in his Spirit, who was able to help and to ſuccour; and we had no Helper in the Earth, but him. And he did hear the <hi>Cries</hi> of his <hi>People,</hi> and did bring an overflowing <hi>Scourge</hi> over the Heads of all our <hi>Perſecutors;</hi> which brought a <hi>Quaking,</hi> and a <hi>Dread,</hi> and a <hi>Fear</hi> amongſt and on them all: So that they, who had nick-named us (who are the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Light</hi>) and in ſcorn called us <hi>Quakers,</hi> the Lord made them <hi>Quake;</hi> and many of them would have been glad to have <hi>hid</hi> themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us: and ſome of them, through the <hi>Diſtreſs</hi> that came upon them, did at length come to <hi>Confeſs</hi> to the <hi>Truth.</hi> Oh! the daily
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:51448:209"/> 
               <hi>Reproaches, Revilings</hi> and <hi>Beatings</hi> we underwent amongſt them, even in the <hi>High-ways,</hi> becauſe we could not <hi>put off our Hats</hi> to them; and for ſaying <hi>Thou</hi> and <hi>Thee</hi> to them! Oh! the <hi>Havock</hi> and <hi>Spoil</hi> the <hi>Priests</hi> made of our <hi>Goods,</hi> becauſe we could not put into their Mouths, and give them <hi>Tithes!</hi> Beſides caſting into <hi>Priſons;</hi> and beſides the great <hi>Fines</hi> laid upon us, becauſe we could not <hi>Swear!</hi> But for all theſe things did the <hi>Lord God</hi> plead with them. Yet ſome of them were ſo hardened in their Wickedneſs, that, when they were turned out of their <hi>Places</hi> and <hi>Offices,</hi> they ſaid; <hi>If they had Power, they would do the ſame again.</hi> And when this <hi>Day</hi> of <hi>overturning</hi> was come upon them, they ſaid; <hi>It was all long of us.</hi> Wherefore I was moved to write to them, and to ask them, <q>Did we ever reſiſt them, when they took away our <hi>Ploughs</hi> and <hi>Plough-Gears,</hi> our <hi>Carts</hi> and <hi>Horſes,</hi> our <hi>Corn</hi> and <hi>Cattel,</hi> our <hi>Kettles</hi> and <hi>Platters</hi> from us, and <hi>whipt</hi> us, and ſet us in the <hi>Stocks,</hi> and caſt us into <hi>Priſon;</hi> and all this only for ſerving and worſhipping God in Spirit and Truth, and becauſe we could not Conform to their <hi>Religions, Manners, Cuſtoms</hi> and <hi>Faſhions?</hi> Did we ever reſiſt them? Did we not give them our <hi>Backs</hi> to beat, and our <hi>Cheeks</hi> to pull off the Hair, and our <hi>Faces</hi> to ſpit on? Had not their <hi>Priests,</hi> that prompted them on to ſuch Work, plucked <hi>them</hi> with <hi>themſelves</hi> into the Ditch? Why then would they ſay, <hi>It was all long of us?</hi> when it was long of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and their <hi>Prieſts,</hi> their <hi>blind Prophets,</hi> that followed their own Spirits, and could fore-ſee nothing of theſe times and things, that were come upon them, which we had long forewarned them of; as <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> had forewarned <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And they thought to have wearied us out, and <hi>undone</hi> us; but they <hi>undid</hi> themſelves: Whereas we could praiſe God, notwithſtanding all their <hi>plundering</hi> of us, that we had a <hi>Kettle,</hi> and a <hi>Platter,</hi> and an <hi>Horſe,</hi> and <hi>Plow</hi> ſtill.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Many ways were theſe <hi>Profeſſors</hi> warned, both by <hi>Word,</hi> by <hi>Writing</hi> and by <hi>Signs;</hi> but they would believe none, till it was too late. <hi>William Sympſon</hi> was moved of the <hi>Lord</hi> to go at ſeveral times for <hi>Three Years, Naked</hi> and <hi>Bare-foot</hi> before them, as a <hi>Sign</hi> unto them, in <hi>Markets, Courts, Towns, Cities,</hi> to <hi>Prieſt's</hi> Houſes, and to <hi>Great Men's</hi> Houſes, telling them; <hi>So ſhould they be all ſtripped</hi> Naked, <hi>as he was ſtripped</hi> Naked! And ſometimes he was moved to put on <hi>Hair-Sack-cloth,</hi> and to <hi>beſmear his Face,</hi> and to tell them; <hi>So would the</hi> Lord God <hi>beſmear all their Religion, as he was beſmeared!</hi> Great Sufferings did that <hi>poor Man</hi> undergo, ſore <hi>Whippings</hi> with <hi>Horſe-whips</hi> and <hi>Coach-whips</hi> on his bare Body, grievous <hi>Stonings</hi> and <hi>Impriſonments</hi> in three years time, before the <hi>King</hi> came in, that they might have taken Warning, but they would not; but rewarded his Love with <hi>cruel <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage.</hi> Only the <hi>Major</hi> of <hi>Cambridge</hi> did nobly to him; for he put his <hi>Gown</hi> about him, and took him into his Houſe.</p>
            <p>Another <hi>Friend,</hi> one <hi>Robert Huntington,</hi> was moved of the <hi>Lord</hi> to go into <hi>Carliſle-Steeple-houſe</hi> with a <hi>White Sheet</hi> about him, amongſt the great <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independents</hi> there, to ſhew them, that the <hi>Surplice</hi> was coming up again: and he put an <hi>Halter</hi> about his <hi>Neck,</hi> to ſhew them, That an <hi>Halter</hi> was coming upon them: which was fulfilled upon ſome of our <hi>Perſecutors</hi> not long after.</p>
            <pb n="240" facs="tcp:51448:210"/>
            <p>Another, whoſe Name was <hi>Richard Sale,</hi> living near <hi>Weſt-Cheſter,</hi> and being <hi>Constable</hi> of the place, where he lived, had a <hi>Friend</hi> ſent to him with a <hi>Paſs,</hi> (whom thoſe wicked <hi>Profeſſors</hi> had taken up for a <hi>Vagabond,</hi> becauſe he travelled up and down in the <hi>Work</hi> of the <hi>Ministry</hi>) and this <hi>Conſtable</hi> being <hi>convinced</hi> by the <hi>Friend,</hi> that was thus brought to him, gave him his <hi>Paſs</hi> and <hi>Liberty;</hi> and was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards himſelf caſt into <hi>Priſon.</hi> After this, on a <hi>Lecture</hi>-day, this <hi>Richard Sale</hi> was moved to go to the <hi>Steeple-houſe</hi> in the time of their Worſhip, and to carry thoſe perſecuting <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>People</hi> a <hi>Lanthorn</hi> and <hi>Candle,</hi> as a Figure of their <hi>Darkneſs:</hi> But they cruelly abuſed him, and like <hi>dark Profeſſors,</hi> as they were, they put him into their <hi>Priſon,</hi> called <hi>Little-Eaſe;</hi> and ſo ſqueezed his Body therein, that not long after he <hi>Died.</hi> Many <hi>Warnings</hi> of many ſorts were <hi>Friends</hi> moved in the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> to give unto that <hi>Generation;</hi> which they not only rejected, but abuſed <hi>Friends,</hi> calling us <hi>Giddy-headed Quakers:</hi> But <hi>God</hi> brought his Judgments upon thoſe <hi>Perſecuting Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Magiſtrates.</hi> For when the <hi>King</hi> came in, moſt of them were turned out of their <hi>Places</hi> and <hi>Benefices;</hi> and the <hi>Spoilers were Spoiled:</hi> And then we could ask them, Who were the <hi>Giddy-heads</hi> now? Then many did confeſs, we had been <hi>True Prophets</hi> to the Nation; and ſaid, <hi>Had</hi> we cried againſt <hi>ſome Prieſts only,</hi> they ſhould have liked us then; but we crying againſt <hi>All,</hi> that made them diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like us: <hi>But</hi> now they did ſee, that thoſe <hi>Priests,</hi> which then were looked upon to be the <hi>beſt,</hi> were as <hi>bad</hi> as the <hi>Reſt.</hi> For indeed, ſome of thoſe, that were counted the <hi>moſt-Eminent Prieſts,</hi> were the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and greateſt Stirrers up of the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> to <hi>Perſecution:</hi> And it was a <hi>Judgment</hi> upon them, to be denied the <hi>Free Liberty</hi> of their <hi>Conſciences,</hi> when the <hi>King</hi> came in; becauſe when they were upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, they would not have had <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>Conſcience</hi> been granted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>others.</hi> For there was one <hi>Hewes</hi> of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> a <hi>Prieſt</hi> of great Note in <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Days, who, when ſome <hi>Liberty</hi> was granted, pray'd, <hi>That God would put it into the Hearts of the Chief Magiſtrates of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to remove this curſed</hi> Toleration: And others of them prayed againſt it, by the name of <hi>Intolerable Toleration.</hi> But a while after, when the <hi>King</hi> was come in, and Prieſt <hi>Hewes</hi> turned out of his great <hi>Benefice,</hi> for not Conforming to the <hi>Common-Prayer;</hi> a <hi>Friend</hi> of <hi>Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> meeting with him, asked him, <hi>Whether he would account</hi> Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration <hi>Accurſed now?</hi> And <hi>Whether he would not now be glad of a</hi> To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration? To which the <hi>Prieſt</hi> returned no <hi>Anſwer,</hi> ſave by the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of his Head. But as ſtiff as this ſort of Men were then againſt <hi>Toleration,</hi> it is well known, that many of them <hi>petitioned</hi> the <hi>King</hi> for <hi>Toleration,</hi> and for <hi>Meeting-Places;</hi> and paid for <hi>Licences</hi> too. But to return to the preſent Time, the latter end of the Year 1660. and beginning of 1661.</p>
            <p>Although thoſe <hi>Friends,</hi> that had been <hi>Impriſoned</hi> upon the Riſing of thoſe <hi>Monarchy-Men,</hi> were ſet at <hi>Liberty;</hi> yet <hi>Meetings</hi> were much diſturbed, and great <hi>Sufferings Friends</hi> went under: For beſides what was done by <hi>Officers</hi> and <hi>Souldiers,</hi> many wild Fellows and rude People often came in. There came one time, when I was at <hi>Pell-Mell,</hi> an <hi>Embaſſador</hi> with a Company of <hi>Iriſh Men</hi> with rude Fellows: The <hi>Meeting</hi> was done before they came, and I was gone
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:51448:210"/> up into a Chamber, where I heard one of them ſay, he would <hi>kill all the Quakers.</hi> So I went down to him, and was moved in the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> to ſpeak to him: and I told him, The <hi>Law</hi> ſaid, <hi>An Eye for an Eye,</hi> and a <hi>Tooth for a Tooth:</hi> but thou threatens <hi>to kill all the</hi> Quakers, <hi>though they have done thee no hurt.</hi> But ſaid I, here is <hi>Goſpel</hi> for thee: <hi>Here's my Hair, and here's my Cheek, and here's my Shoulder,</hi> turning it to him. This came ſo over him, that he and his <hi>Companions</hi> ſtood as Men amazed, and ſaid; If that was our <hi>Principle,</hi> and if we were as we ſaid, they never ſaw the like in their Lives. I told them, What I was in <hi>Words,</hi> I was the ſame in <hi>Life.</hi> Then the <hi>Embaſſador</hi> came in (for he had ſtood without; for he ſaid, that <hi>Iriſh Colonel</hi> was ſuch a <hi>deſperate Man,</hi> that he durſt not come in with him, for fear, he ſhould have done us ſome <hi>Miſchief:</hi>) but <hi>Truth</hi> came over him, and he carried himſelf lovingly towards us; and ſo did the <hi>Embaſſador</hi> alſo: for the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> was over them all.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Mile-End Friends</hi> were kept out of their <hi>Meeting-Place</hi> by <hi>Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers;</hi> but <hi>Friends</hi> ſtood Nobly in the <hi>Truth,</hi> and were Valiant for the <hi>Lord's Name:</hi> and at laſt the <hi>Truth</hi> gave them Dominion.</p>
            <p>About this time we had Account, that <hi>John Love,</hi> a <hi>Friend,</hi> that was moved to go and bear <hi>Teſtimony</hi> againſt the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> was <hi>dead in Priſon</hi> at <hi>Rome:</hi> and it was ſuſpected, he was privately put to Death in <hi>Priſon. John Perrot</hi> was alſo <hi>Priſoner</hi> there; and being releaſed, came over again: But after his Arrival here, he with <hi>Charles Baily,</hi> and ſome others, turned aſide from the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Truth.</hi> Whereupon I was moved to give forth a <hi>Paper,</hi> declaring, how the <hi>Lord</hi> would <hi>blaſt them all,</hi> both him and his <hi>Followers</hi> (if they did not <hi>Repent</hi> and <hi>Return</hi>) and that they ſhould <hi>wither,</hi> like the <hi>Graſs</hi> on the <hi>Houſe-top:</hi> and ſo many of them did; but others of them <hi>returned</hi> and <hi>repented.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alſo before this time we received Account from <hi>New-England,</hi> 
               <q>That the <hi>Government</hi> there had made a <hi>Law</hi> to <hi>Baniſh the Quakers out of their Colonies, upon pain of Death, in caſe they returned;</hi> and that ſeveral of our <hi>Friends,</hi> having been ſo <hi>baniſhed,</hi> and <hi>returning,</hi> were thereupon taken, and actually <hi>Hanged:</hi> and that divers more were in <hi>Priſon,</hi> in danger of the like <hi>Sentence</hi> to be executed upon them.</q> When thoſe were put to <hi>Death,</hi> I was in <hi>Priſon</hi> at <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and had a perfect Senſe of their <hi>Sufferings,</hi> as though it had been my ſelf; and as though the <hi>Halter</hi> had been put about my own <hi>Neck;</hi> though we had not at that time heard of it. But as ſoon as we heard of it, <hi>Edward Burrough</hi> went to the <hi>King,</hi> and told him; <hi>There was a Vein of</hi> Innocent Blood <hi>opened in his Dominions, which, if it were not ſtopt, would over-run all.</hi> To which the <hi>King</hi> replied, <hi>But I will ſtop that Vein. Edward Burrough</hi> ſaid; Then do it ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for we know not, how many may ſoon be put to <hi>Death.</hi> The <hi>King</hi> anſwered, <hi>As ſpeedily, as ye will. Call</hi> (ſaid he to ſome preſent) <hi>the Secretary, and I will do it preſently</hi> So the <hi>Secretary</hi> being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, a <hi>Mandamus</hi> was forthwith granted. A Day or two after, <hi>Ed. Burrough</hi> going again to the <hi>King,</hi> to deſire, the matter might be expedited; the <hi>King</hi> ſaid, He had no Occaſion at preſent to ſend a <hi>Ship</hi> thither: but if we would ſend one, we might do it, as ſoon as we would. <hi>Ed. Burrough</hi> then asked the <hi>King,</hi> If it would pleaſe him,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:51448:211"/> to grant his <hi>Deputation</hi> to one called a <hi>Quaker,</hi> to carry the <hi>Manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> to <hi>New-England,</hi> (which is hereafter inſerted.) He ſaid, <hi>Yes, to whom ye will.</hi> Whereupon <hi>E. B.</hi> named one <hi>Samuel Shattock</hi> (as I remember) who being an Inhabitant of <hi>New-England,</hi> was <hi>baniſhed</hi> by their <hi>Law,</hi> to be <hi>hanged,</hi> if he came again: and to him the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation</hi> was granted. Then we ſent for one <hi>Ralph Goldſmith,</hi> an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt <hi>Friend,</hi> who was <hi>Maſter</hi> of a good <hi>Ship;</hi> and with him we agreed for <hi>Three Hundred Pounds,</hi> (Goods, or no Goods) to <hi>Sail</hi> in <hi>Ten</hi> Days. He forthwith prepared to ſet Sail; and with a proſperous Gale, in about <hi>Six Weeks</hi> time, arrived before the Town of <hi>Boston</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> upon a <hi>Firſt-Day</hi> Morning, called <hi>Sunday.</hi> With him went many <hi>Paſſengers,</hi> both of <hi>New</hi> and <hi>Old England,</hi> that were <hi>Friends,</hi> whom the <hi>Lord</hi> did move to go to bear their <hi>Teſtimony</hi> againſt thoſe <hi>Bloody Perſecutors,</hi> who had exceeded all the World in that Age, in their <hi>Bloody Perſecutions.</hi> The <hi>Townſ-men</hi> at <hi>Boſton,</hi> ſeeing a <hi>Ship</hi> come into the <hi>Bay</hi> with <hi>Engliſh Colours,</hi> ſoon came on Board, and ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the <hi>Captain: Ralph Goldſmith</hi> told them, He was the <hi>Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi> They asked him, if he had any <hi>Letters?</hi> He ſaid, <hi>Yes.</hi> They asked, If he would deliver them? He ſaid, <hi>No, not to day.</hi> So they went a-ſhore, and reported, There was a <hi>Ship</hi> full of <hi>Quakers,</hi> and that <hi>Samuel Shattock</hi> was among them; who they knew, was by their <hi>Law</hi> to be put to <hi>Death,</hi> for coming again after <hi>Baniſhment:</hi> but they knew not his <hi>Errand,</hi> nor his <hi>Authority.</hi> So all being kept cloſe that day, and none of the <hi>Ships-Company</hi> ſuffered to go on <hi>Shore;</hi> next morning <hi>Samuel Shattock,</hi> the <hi>King's Deputy,</hi> and <hi>Ralph Goldſmith,</hi> the <hi>Commander</hi> of the <hi>Veſſel,</hi> went on <hi>Shore;</hi> and ſending back to the <hi>Ship</hi> the Men that landed them, they <hi>two</hi> went through the <hi>Town</hi> to the <hi>Governour</hi>'s, <hi>John Endicott</hi>'s, Door, and knock't. He ſent out a <hi>Man,</hi> to know their Buſineſs: They ſent him Word, their Buſineſs was from the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and they would deliver their <hi>Meſſage</hi> to none, but the <hi>Governour</hi> himſelf. Thereupon they were admitted to go in, and the <hi>Governour</hi> came to them; and having received the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation</hi> and the <hi>Mandamus,</hi> he laid off his Hat, and look'd upon them: then going out, he bid the <hi>Friends</hi> follow him. So he went to the <hi>Deputy-Governour;</hi> and after a ſhort Conſultation, came out to the <hi>Friends,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>We ſhall obey his Majeſty's Commands.</hi> After this the <hi>Maſter</hi> gave liberty to the <hi>Paſſengers</hi> to come on <hi>Shore;</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the <hi>Noiſe</hi> of the buſineſs flew about the <hi>Town:</hi> and the <hi>Friends</hi> of the <hi>Town,</hi> and the <hi>Paſſengers</hi> of the <hi>Ship Met</hi> together, to offer up their <hi>Praiſes</hi> and <hi>Thanſgivings</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> who had ſo wonderfully deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them from the <hi>Teeth</hi> of the <hi>Devourer.</hi> While they were thus met, in came a <hi>poor Friend,</hi> who being <hi>Sentenc'd</hi> by their <hi>bloody Law</hi> to <hi>Die,</hi> had lain ſome time in <hi>Irons,</hi> expecting <hi>Execution.</hi> This ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to their <hi>Joy,</hi> and cauſed them to lift up their Hearts in <hi>High Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> who is worthy for ever to have the <hi>Praiſe,</hi> the <hi>Glory</hi> and the <hi>Honour;</hi> for he only is able to deliver, and to ſave, and to ſupport all, that ſincerely put their Truſt in him.

            <p>Some time after this, ſeveral of <hi>New-England</hi>'s <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> came over hither, and one of their <hi>Prieſts;</hi> and we had ſeveral <hi>Diſcourſes</hi> with them, at ſeveral times, concerning their <hi>Murdering our Friends,</hi> the <hi>Servants</hi> of the <hi>Lord:</hi> but they were aſhamed to ſtand to their <hi>Bloody Actions.</hi> At one of thoſe <hi>Meetings</hi> I asked <hi>Simon Broadſtreet,</hi> (who was one of the <hi>New England-Magiſtrates) Whether</hi> he had not an hand in <hi>putting to Death</hi> thoſe <hi>Four Servants</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> whom they <hi>hanged</hi> for being <hi>Quakers</hi> only, as they had nick-named them? And he confeſſed, <hi>he had.</hi> I then asked him, and the reſt of his <hi>Aſſociates,</hi> that were preſent; <hi>Whether</hi> they would acknowledge themſelves to be <hi>Subjects</hi> to the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>England?</hi> And if they did, By what <hi>Law</hi> they had put our <hi>Friends</hi> to <hi>Death?</hi> They ſaid; They were <hi>Subjects</hi> to the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> and they had <hi>put our Friends to Death by the ſame Law, as the</hi> Jeſuits <hi>were put to Death here in</hi> England. I asked them then; <hi>Whether</hi> they did believe, that thoſe <hi>Friends</hi> of ours, whom they had <hi>put to Death,</hi> were <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> or <hi>Jeſuitically</hi> affected? And the ſaid, <hi>Nay.</hi> Then, ſaid I, Ye have <hi>murdered</hi> them, if ye have
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:51448:212"/> put them to Death by the <hi>Law.</hi> that <hi>Jeſuits</hi> are <hi>put to Death here in</hi> England; and yet confeſs, they were no <hi>Jeſuits.</hi> By this it plainly appears, ye have put them to Death in your own Wills, without any <hi>Law.</hi> Then <hi>Simon Broadſtreet,</hi> finding himſelf and his Company enſnared by their own Words, ſaid; Did we come to <hi>Catch them?</hi> I told them, they had <hi>Catched themſelves,</hi> and they might <hi>juſtly be queſtioned for their Lives;</hi> and if the <hi>Father</hi> of <hi>William Robinſon</hi> (who was one of them, that was put to Death) were in Town, it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, he would queſtion them, and bring their <hi>Lives</hi> into Jeopardy. Hereupon they began to excuſe themſelves, ſaying; <hi>There was no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution now amongſt them:</hi> But <hi>next</hi> morning we had <hi>Letters</hi> from <hi>New-England,</hi> giving us Account, that our <hi>Friends were perſecuted there afreſh.</hi> Thereupon we went to them again, and ſhewed them our <hi>Letters;</hi> which put them both to <hi>Silence</hi> and to <hi>Shame:</hi> and in <hi>great Fear</hi> they ſeemed to be, leſt ſome ſhould call them to Account, and <hi>proſecute</hi> them for their <hi>Lives;</hi> eſpecially <hi>Simon Broadſtreet:</hi> for he had at firſt, before ſo many <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> confeſs'd, <hi>He had a hand in putting our</hi> Friends <hi>to death;</hi> that he could not get off from it; though he afterwards through Fear <hi>ſhuffled,</hi> and would have unſaid it again. But after this, he and the reſt of them ſoon left the <hi>City,</hi> and got back to <hi>New-England</hi> again. I went alſo to <hi>Governour Winthrop,</hi> and diſcourſed with him about theſe matters: but he aſſured me, he <hi>had no hand in putting our</hi> Friends <hi>to Death, or in any way perſecuting of them; but was one of them that protested againſt it.</hi> Now theſe <hi>stingy Perſecutors</hi> of <hi>New-England</hi> were a <hi>People,</hi> that fled out of <hi>Old England</hi> thither, from the <hi>Perſecution</hi> of the <hi>Biſhops</hi> here: But when they had got <hi>Power</hi> into their hands, they ſo far exceeded the <hi>Biſhops</hi> in <hi>Severity</hi> and <hi>Cruelty,</hi> that whereas the <hi>Biſhops</hi> had made them pay <hi>Twelve Pence</hi> a <hi>Sunday</hi> (ſo called) <hi>for not coming to their Worſhip here,</hi> they impoſed a <hi>Fine</hi> of <hi>Five Shillings a Day</hi> upon ſuch, as ſhould not conform to their <hi>Will-Worſhip</hi> there; and ſpoiled the <hi>Goods</hi> of <hi>Friends,</hi> that could not pay it. Beſides, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny they <hi>Impriſoned,</hi> divers they <hi>Whipt,</hi> and that moſt <hi>Cruelly;</hi> of ſome they <hi>Cut off Ears,</hi> and ſome they <hi>Hanged:</hi> as the <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Friends Sufferings</hi> in <hi>New-England</hi> largely ſhew; particularly, A Book written by <hi>Geo. Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> Entituled, <hi>New-England judged.</hi> (In Two Parts.) Some of the old <hi>Royaliſts</hi> were earneſt with <hi>Friends</hi> to have <hi>proſecuted</hi> them; but we told them, we left them to the <hi>Lord,</hi> to whom <hi>Vengeance</hi> belonged, and he would <hi>Repay</hi> it. And the <hi>Judgments</hi> of <hi>God</hi> have ſince fallen heavy on them: For the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> have been raiſed up againſt them, and have <hi>Cut off</hi> many of them.</p>
            <p>About this time I loſt a very good <hi>Book,</hi> being <hi>taken</hi> in the <hi>Printer's Hands:</hi> It was a uſeful, teaching <hi>Book,</hi> containing the <hi>Signification</hi> and <hi>Explanation</hi> of <hi>Names, Parables, Types</hi> and <hi>Figures</hi> in the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi> They who took it, were ſo affected with it, that they were loth to have deſtroyed it; but thinking to have made a great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of it, they would have let us have had it again, if we would have given them a <hi>great Sum</hi> of <hi>Money</hi> for it: which we were not free to do.</p>
            <pb n="245" facs="tcp:51448:212"/>
            <p>And ſome time before this, while I was <hi>Priſoner</hi> in <hi>Lancaſter-Caſtle,</hi> the <hi>Book</hi> called the <hi>Battledoor</hi> came forth, which was written to ſhew, that in all Languages <hi>Thou</hi> and <hi>Thee</hi> is the proper and uſual <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Speech</hi> to a <hi>Single Perſon;</hi> and <hi>You</hi> to more than one. This was ſet forth in <hi>Examples</hi> or <hi>Inſtances</hi> taken out of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and out of <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Teaching,</hi> in about <hi>Thirty Languages. John Stubbs</hi> and <hi>Benjamin Furly</hi> took great Pains in the Compiling of it, which I put them upon; and ſome things I added to it. When it was finiſhed, ſome of them were preſented to the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>Council,</hi> to the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> and to the <hi>Two <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities</hi> one a piece; and many bought of them. The <hi>King</hi> ſaid, It was the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Language of all Nations:</hi> And the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> being ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what he thought of it, was ſo <hi>at a stand,</hi> that he could not tell <hi>what to ſay to it.</hi> For it did ſo <hi>Inform</hi> and <hi>Convince</hi> P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>About this time many <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Jeſuits</hi> began to <hi>fawn</hi> upon <hi>Friends,</hi> and talk'd up and down, where they came, that of all the Sects the <hi>Quakers</hi> were the <hi>beſt</hi> and <hi>most ſelf-denying People:</hi> And ſaid, <hi>It was great pity, that they did not return to the Holy Mother Church,</hi> Thus they made a <hi>Buſz</hi> among the <hi>People,</hi> and ſaid; <hi>They would willingly diſcourſe with Friends.</hi> But <hi>Friends</hi> were loth to meddle with them, becauſe they were <hi>Jeſuits;</hi> looking upon it to be both <hi>dangerous</hi> and <hi>ſcandalous.</hi> But when I underſtood it, I ſaid to <hi>Friends; Let us diſcourſe with them, be they what they will.</hi> So a time being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed at <hi>Gerrard Roberts</hi> his Houſe, there came two of them, like <hi>Courtiers.</hi> When we were come together, they asked our <hi>Names;</hi> which we told them: But we did not ask their <hi>Names:</hi> for we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, they were called <hi>Papiſts;</hi> and they knew, we were called <hi>Quakers.</hi> I asked them the ſame <hi>Queſtion,</hi> that I had formerly asked a <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> namely; <hi>Whether the</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> Rome <hi>was not degenerated from the Church in the Primitive Times, from the Spirit, and Power, and Practice, that they were in in the Apoſtles times?</hi> He to whom I put this <hi>Queſtion,</hi> being ſubtile, ſaid, <hi>He would not Anſwer it.</hi> I ask'd him, <hi>Why?</hi> But he would ſhew no Reaſon. His <hi>Companion</hi> ſaid, he would <hi>anſwer</hi> me: and he ſaid, <hi>They were not degenerated from the Church in the Primitive times.</hi> I asked the other, <hi>Whether he was of the ſame Mind?</hi> And he ſaid, <hi>Yes.</hi> Then I told them, that for the better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding one another, and that there might be no Miſtake, I would
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:51448:213"/> repeat my <hi>Queſtion</hi> over again after this manner; <hi>Whether the</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> Rome <hi>now was in the ſame Purity, Practice, Power and Spirit, that the</hi> Church <hi>in the</hi> Apoſtle's <hi>time was in?</hi> When they ſaw, we would be exact with them; they flew off, and denied that, ſaying: <hi>It was Preſumption in any to ſay, they had the ſame Power and Spirit, which the</hi> Apoſtles <hi>had.</hi> But I told them: It was <hi>Preſumption</hi> in them, to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with the <hi>Words</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and make People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, they <hi>ſucceeded</hi> the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and yet be forced to Confeſs, <hi>They were not in the ſame Power and Spirit, that the Apoſtles were in:</hi> This, ſaid I, is a <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Preſumption,</hi> and rebuked by the <hi>Apoſtles Spirit.</hi> Then I ſhewed them, how different their <hi>Fruits</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> were from the <hi>Fruits</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> Then got up one of them, and ſaid; <hi>Ye are a Company of Dreamers.</hi> Nay, ſaid I, ye are the <hi>filthy Dreamers,</hi> who <hi>dream,</hi> ye are the <hi>Apostles Succeſſors;</hi> and yet Confeſs, <hi>Ye have not the ſame Power and Spirit, which the Apostles were in.</hi> And are not they <hi>Defilers</hi> of the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> who ſay, <hi>It is Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption for any to ſay, they have the ſame Power and Spirit, which the Apoſtles had?</hi> Now, ſaid I, if ye have not the ſame <hi>Power and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which the Apoſtles had;</hi> then it is manifeſt, that ye are led by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> than the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> in the Primitive times were led by. Then I began to tell them, how that <hi>Evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> which they were led by, had led them to <hi>Pray</hi> by <hi>Beads,</hi> and to <hi>Images;</hi> and to ſet up <hi>Nunneries,</hi> and <hi>Frieries,</hi> and <hi>Monaſteries,</hi> and to put People to <hi>Death</hi> for <hi>Religion:</hi> and this Practice of theirs I ſhewed them, was below the <hi>Law,</hi> and far ſhort of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> in which is <hi>Liberty.</hi> They were ſoon weary of this <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> and went their way; and gave a Charge (as we heard) to the <hi>Papists,</hi> That <hi>they ſhould not diſpute with us, nor read any of our Books:</hi> So we were rid of them. But we had Reaſonings with all the other Sects, as <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians, Independents, Seekers, Baptiſts, Epiſcopal-men, Socinians, Browniſts, Lutherans, Calvinists, Arminians, Fifth-Monarchy-Men, Familiſts, Muggletonians</hi> and <hi>Ranters;</hi> none of which would Affirm, they had the ſame <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had, and were in: So in that <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> gave us <hi>Dominion</hi> over them all.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Fifth-Monarchy-Men,</hi> I was moved to give forth a <hi>Paper</hi> to them, to manifeſt their <hi>Error</hi> to them: For they looked for <hi>Chriſt's Perſonal Coming</hi> in an outward <hi>Form</hi> and <hi>Manner;</hi> and they fixed the time of it to the Year 1666; at which time ſome of them did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare themſelves, when it <hi>Thundered</hi> and <hi>Rained,</hi> thinking <hi>Chriſt</hi> was then come to ſet up his Kingdom: and then they imagined, they were to <hi>kill</hi> the <hi>Whore without them.</hi> But I told them, the <hi>Whore</hi> was alive <hi>in them,</hi> and was not <hi>burnt</hi> with God's Fire, nor judged in them with the ſame <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were in. And their looking for <hi>Chriſt's Coming</hi> outwardly, to ſet up his Kingdom, was like the <hi>Phariſees Lo here,</hi> and <hi>Lo there.</hi> But <hi>Chriſt</hi> was come, and had ſet up his <hi>Kingdom</hi> above <hi>Sixteen Hundred Years</hi> ago (according to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s <hi>Dream,</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi>'s <hi>Prophecy</hi>) and he had daſh'd to pieces the <hi>Four Monarchies,</hi> the great <hi>Image,</hi> with its Head of <hi>Gold, Breaſt</hi> and <hi>Arms</hi> of <hi>Silver, Belly</hi> and <hi>Thighs</hi> of <hi>Braſs, Legs</hi> of <hi>Iron,</hi> and <hi>Feet</hi> part of <hi>Iron,</hi> part of <hi>Clay:</hi> and they were all blown away
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:51448:214"/> with God's Wind, as the <hi>Chaff</hi> in the <hi>Summer-threſhing-Floor.</hi> And when <hi>Christ</hi> was on Earth, he ſaid, his <hi>Kingdom</hi> was not of this World: If it had been, his Servants would have <hi>fought;</hi> but it was not, therefore his Servants did not <hi>fight.</hi> And therefore all the <hi>Fifth-Monarchy-Men,</hi> that be <hi>Fighters</hi> with Carnal Weapons, are none of <hi>Chriſt's Servants,</hi> but the <hi>Beaſt's</hi> and the <hi>Whore's.</hi> Chriſt ſaid, <hi>All Power in Heaven and in Earth is given to me:</hi> So then, his <hi>Kingdom</hi> was ſet up above <hi>Sixteen Hundred Years</hi> ago, and he Reigns. And we ſee <hi>Jeſus Reign,</hi> ſaid the Apoſtle, and he ſhall <hi>Reign,</hi> till all things be put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Feet; though all things are not yet put under his Feet, nor ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued.</p>
            <p>This year ſeveral <hi>Friends</hi> were moved to go beyond the <hi>Seas,</hi> to publiſh <hi>Truth</hi> in <hi>Forreign Countries. John Stubbs,</hi> and <hi>Henry Fell,</hi> and <hi>Richard Coſtrop</hi> were moved to go towards <hi>China,</hi> and <hi>Preſter John</hi>'s <hi>Country;</hi> but no <hi>Maſters</hi> of <hi>Ships</hi> would carry them. With much ado they got a <hi>Warrant</hi> from the <hi>King;</hi> but the <hi>Eaſt-India-Company</hi> found ways to avoid it, and the <hi>Maſters</hi> of their <hi>Ships</hi> would not carry them. Then they went into <hi>Holland,</hi> hoping to have got <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage</hi> there; but no <hi>Paſſage</hi> could they get there neither. Then <hi>John Stubs</hi> and <hi>Henry Fell</hi> took <hi>Shipping</hi> to go to <hi>Alexandria</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to go by the <hi>Carravans</hi> from thence. Mean while <hi>Daniel Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> being to go to <hi>Smirna,</hi> he drew <hi>Richard Coſtrop,</hi> contrary to his own Freedom, to go along with him. And in the <hi>paſſage Richard</hi> falling ſick, <hi>D. Baker</hi> left him <hi>ſick</hi> in the <hi>Ship;</hi> where he <hi>died:</hi> But that <hi>hard-hearted Man</hi> afterwards loſt his own Condition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Stubbs</hi> and <hi>Henry Fell</hi> got to <hi>Alexandria</hi> in <hi>Egypt;</hi> but they had not been long there, before the <hi>Engliſh Conſul baniſhed</hi> them from thence: Yet before they came away, they diſperſed many <hi>Books</hi> and <hi>Papers</hi> there, for the opening the <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Way</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> to the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Grecians.</hi> They gave the <hi>Book</hi> called, <hi>The Popes Strength broken,</hi> to an <hi>Old Frier,</hi> for him to give or ſend to the <hi>Pope:</hi> which <hi>Book,</hi> when the <hi>Frier</hi> had peruſed, he clapped his Hand upon his <hi>Breaſt,</hi> and confeſs'd, <hi>What was written therein, was Truth: but,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>if I ſhould confeſs to it openly, they would burn me.</hi> So <hi>John Stubs</hi> and <hi>Henry Fell</hi> not being ſuffered to go farther, returned to <hi>England;</hi> and came to <hi>London</hi> again. And <hi>John</hi> had a <hi>Viſion,</hi> that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> who had <hi>joined together</hi> not to carry them, <hi>would fall out one with the other:</hi> And ſo it came to paſs.</p>
            <p>Having now ſtay'd in <hi>London</hi> ſome time, I felt drawings to viſit <hi>Friends</hi> in <hi>Eſſex.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eſſex. <hi>Colcheſter</hi> Cogſhall.</note> So I went down to <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> where I had very large <hi>Meetings:</hi> and from thence to <hi>Cogshall;</hi> not far from which there was a <hi>Prieſt Convinced,</hi> and I had a Meeting at his Houſe. And ſo tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling a little up and down in thoſe Parts, and viſiting <hi>Friends</hi> in their <hi>Meetings</hi> there-aways,<note place="margin">London.</note> I returned pretty quickly to <hi>London,</hi> where I found great <hi>Service</hi> for the <hi>Lord:</hi> For a large <hi>Door</hi> was <hi>opened,</hi> and many flocked in to our <hi>Meetings,</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Truth</hi> ſpread mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this Year. Yet <hi>Friends</hi> had great <hi>Travels,</hi> and ſore <hi>Labours;</hi> the rude People having been ſo heightned by the <hi>Monarchy-Men's Riſing</hi> a little before. But the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> was over all, and in it <hi>Friends</hi> had Dominion: though we had not only thoſe <hi>Sufferings without,</hi> but <hi>Sufferings within</hi> alſo by <hi>John Perrot</hi> and his Company; who giving
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:51448:214"/> heed to a <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Deluſion,</hi> ſought to introduce and ſet up among <hi>Friends</hi> that evil and uncomely Practice of <hi>keeping on the Hat in time of publick Prayers.</hi> Now <hi>Friends</hi> had ſpoken to him, and divers of his <hi>Followers</hi> about it; and I had written to them concerning it; but He and ſome others rather ſtrengthened themſelves againſt <hi>Friends</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Wherefore feeling the <hi>Judgment</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> riſe againſt it, I gave forth the following <hi>Lines,</hi> as a <hi>Warning to all, that were concerned</hi> therein.</p>

            <p>Among the <hi>Exerciſes</hi> and <hi>Troubles,</hi> that <hi>Friends</hi> had from without, one was concerning <hi>Friends Marriages,</hi> which ſometimes were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>lled in queſtion. And in this Year there happened to be a <hi>Cauſe Tryed</hi> at the <hi>Aſſize</hi> at <hi>Nottingham</hi> concerning a <hi>Friend's Marriage:</hi> The <hi>Caſe</hi> was thus. Some Years before, <hi>Two Friends</hi> were joined together in <hi>Marriage</hi> amongſt <hi>Friends,</hi> and lived together as <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Wife</hi> about <hi>two Years.</hi> Then the <hi>Man</hi> died, leaving his <hi>Wife</hi> with <hi>Child;</hi> and leaving an <hi>Eſtate</hi> in <hi>Lands</hi> of <hi>Copy-hold.</hi> When the <hi>Woman</hi> was delivered, the <hi>Jury</hi> preſented the Child <hi>Heir</hi> to its Father's Lands; and accordingly the <hi>Child</hi> was admitted: Afterwards another <hi>Friend</hi> married the <hi>Widow.</hi> And after that a Man, that was <hi>Near of Kin</hi> to her former Husband, brought his <hi>Action</hi> againſt the <hi>Friend,</hi> that had laſt married her; endeavouring to diſpoſſeſs them, and deprive the <hi>Child</hi> of the <hi>Inheritance,</hi> and to poſſeſs himſelf thereof, as next <hi>Heir</hi> to the Woman's firſt Husband. And to effect this, he endeavoured to prove the <hi>Child Illegitimate,</hi> alledging; <hi>The Marriage was not according to Law.</hi> In opening the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> the <hi>Plaintiff's Counſel</hi> did uſe unſeemly Words concerning <hi>Friends,</hi> ſaying; <hi>That they went together like Brute Beaſts:</hi> with other ill Expreſſions. After the <hi>Counſels</hi> on both ſides had pleaded, the <hi>Judge (viz. Judge Archer)</hi> took the matter in hand, and opened it to the <hi>Jury,</hi> telling them; <hi>That there was a</hi> Marriage <hi>in</hi> Paradiſe, <hi>when</hi> Adam <hi>took</hi> Eve, <hi>and</hi> Eve <hi>took</hi> Adam; <hi>and that it was the Conſent of the Parties that made a</hi> Marriage. <hi>And for the</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, (he ſaid) <hi>he did not know their Opinions; but he did not believe,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:51448:215"/> they went together, as Brute Beaſts, as had been ſaid of them; but as Chriſtians: and therefore he did believe, the</hi> Marriage <hi>was lawful, and the</hi> Child <hi>lawful Heir.</hi> And the better to ſatisfie the <hi>Jury,</hi> he brought them a <hi>Caſe</hi> to this purpoſe. <hi>A Man, that was weak of Body, and kept his Bed, had a deſire in that Condition to</hi> Marry; <hi>and did declare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Witneſſes, that he did take ſuch a Woman to be his Wife; and the Woman declared, that ſhe took that Man to be her Husband. This</hi> Marriage <hi>was afterwards called in Question; and</hi> (as the <hi>Judge</hi> ſaid) <hi>all the Biſhops did at that time conclude it to be a Lawful Marriage.</hi> Hereupon the <hi>Jury</hi> gave in their <hi>Verdict</hi> for the <hi>Friend's Child,</hi> and againſt the Man, that would have deprived it of its Inheritance.</p>
            <p>About this time the <hi>Oaths</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Supremacy</hi> were tendred unto <hi>Friends,</hi> as a <hi>Snare,</hi> becauſe it was known, we could not <hi>Swear;</hi> and thereupon many were <hi>Impriſoned,</hi> and divers <hi>Premunired.</hi> Upon that occaſion <hi>Friends</hi> publiſhed in Print the <hi>Grounds and Reaſons, why they refuſed to ſwear:</hi> Beſides which I was moved to give forth theſe few <hi>Lines</hi> following, to be given to the <hi>Magiſtrates:</hi>

            <p>Now after I had made ſome ſtay in <hi>London,</hi> and had cleared my ſelf of thoſe <hi>Services,</hi> that at that time lay upon me there, I went into the <hi>Country;</hi> having with me <hi>Alexander Parker</hi> and <hi>John Stubbs</hi> (who was lately come back from <hi>Alexandria</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> as was men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before.) We travelled down through the <hi>Countries,</hi> viſiting <hi>Friends Meetings,</hi> till we came to <hi>Briſtol.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Briſtol.</note> When we were come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we underſtood, that the <hi>Officers</hi> were likely to come, and <hi>break up the Meeting.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mead-<hi>Meeting.</hi>
               </note> Yet on the <hi>Firſt-Day</hi> we went to the <hi>Meeting</hi> at <hi>Broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mead:</hi> And <hi>Alexander Parker</hi> ſtanding up firſt to Declare, while he was ſpeaking, the <hi>Officers</hi> came up, and took him away. After he was gone, I ſtood up in the Eternal <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and declared the Everlaſting <hi>Truth</hi> of the <hi>Lord God;</hi> and the Heavenly <hi>Power</hi> came over all, and the <hi>Meeting</hi> was quiet the reſt of the time, and brake up peaceably. I tarried, till the <hi>Firſt-Day</hi> following; viſiting <hi>Friends,</hi> and being viſited by <hi>Friends.</hi> On the <hi>Firſt-Day</hi> in the Morning ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Friends</hi> came to me to <hi>Edward Pyot</hi>'s Houſe, (where I lay the Night before) and uſed great Endeavours to perſwade me, not to go to the <hi>Meeting</hi> that day; for the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> (they ſaid) had <hi>threatned to take me, and had raiſed the Trained Bands.</hi> I wiſht them to go their way to the <hi>Meeting;</hi> not telling them, what I intended to do: but I told <hi>Ed. Pyot,</hi> I intended to go to the <hi>Meeting;</hi> and he ſent his Son with me, to ſhew me the Way from his Houſe by the <hi>Fields.</hi> As I went, I met divers <hi>Friends,</hi> who were coming to me to prevent my going; and did what they could, to ſtop me: <hi>What,</hi> ſaid one, <hi>Wilt thou go into the Mouth of the</hi> Beaſt! <hi>Wilt thou go into the Mouth of the</hi> Dragon, ſaid another! But I put them by, and went on. When I came into the <hi>Meeting, Margaret Thomas</hi> was ſpeaking; and when ſhe had done, I ſtood up. Now I ſaw a <hi>Concern</hi> and <hi>Fear</hi> upon <hi>Friends</hi> for me; but the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> in which I declared, ſoon ſtruck the <hi>Fear</hi> out of them: and <hi>Life</hi> ſprang, and an Heavenly, Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Meeting</hi> we had. After I had Cleared my ſelf, of what was upon me from the <hi>Lord</hi> to the <hi>Meeting,</hi> I was moved to <hi>Pray:</hi> and after I had <hi>prayed,</hi> and was ſtept down; I was moved to ſtand up again, and tell <hi>Friends, Now they might ſee, there was a God in</hi> Iſrael, <hi>that could deliver.</hi> A very large, full <hi>Meeting</hi> this was, and very hot: but <hi>Truth</hi> was over all, and the <hi>Life</hi> was up, which carried through all; and the <hi>Meeting</hi> broke up in <hi>Peace.</hi> For the <hi>Officers</hi> and <hi>Souldiers</hi> had been breaking up another <hi>Meeting,</hi> which had taken up their time;
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:51448:217"/> ſo that our <hi>Meeting</hi> was ended,<note place="margin">1662. Broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mead-Meeting.</note> before they came. But I underſtood afterwards, they were in a great Rage, that they had <hi>miſſed</hi> me; for they were heard to ſay one to another before, <hi>I'll warrant, we ſhall have him:</hi> but the <hi>Lord</hi> prevented them. I went from the <hi>Meeting</hi> to <hi>Joan Hily's,</hi> where many <hi>Friends</hi> came to ſee me; rejoycing and bleſſing God for our Deliverance. In the <hi>Evening</hi> I had a fine freſh <hi>Meeting</hi> among <hi>Friends,</hi> at a <hi>Friend's</hi> Houſe over the <hi>Water,</hi> where <hi>Friends</hi> were much refreſhed in the <hi>Lord.</hi> After this I ſtay'd moſt part of that Week in <hi>Briſtol,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Briſtol.</note> and at <hi>Edward Pyott's. Edward</hi> was brought ſo low and weak with an <hi>Ague,</hi> that when I came firſt thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he was lookt upon as a <hi>Dying Man:</hi> but it pleaſed the <hi>Lord</hi> to raiſe him up again; ſo that, before I went away, his <hi>Ague</hi> left him, and he was finely well.</p>
            <p>Now having been <hi>two Firſt-Days</hi> together at the <hi>Meeting</hi> at <hi>Broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mead,</hi> and feeling my Spirit clear of <hi>Briſtol;</hi> I went next <hi>Firſt-Day</hi> to a <hi>Meeting</hi> in the <hi>Country</hi> not far from <hi>Briſtol,</hi> And after the <hi>Meeting</hi> was over, ſome <hi>Friends,</hi> that came from <hi>Briſtol,</hi> told me, that the <hi>Souldiers</hi> that day had beſet the <hi>Meeting-Houſe</hi> round at <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol;</hi> and then went up, ſaying. <hi>They would be ſure to have me now:</hi> But when they came up, and found me not there, they were in a great <hi>Rage;</hi> and kept the <hi>Friends</hi> in the <hi>Meeting-houſe</hi> moſt part of the day, before they would let them go home; and queried of them, <hi>Which way I was gone, and how they might ſend after me? For the Major,</hi> they ſaid, <hi>would fain have ſpoken with me.</hi> But I had a <hi>Viſion</hi> of a great <hi>Maſtiff Dog,</hi> that <hi>would have bitten me: but I put one hand above his Jaws, and the other hand below, and tore his Jaws to pieces.</hi> So the <hi>Lord</hi> by his <hi>Power</hi> tore their <hi>Power</hi> to <hi>pieces,</hi> and made way for me to eſcape them. Then paſſed I through the Countries, viſiting <hi>Friends</hi> in <hi>Wiltſhire</hi> and <hi>Barkſhire,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Wiltſhire. Barkſhire. <hi>London.</hi>
               </note> till I came to <hi>London;</hi> and had great <hi>Meetings</hi> amongſt <hi>Friends,</hi> as I went: and the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> was over all; and a bleſſed time it was for the ſpreading of his glorious <hi>Truth.</hi> It was indeed the Immediate <hi>Hand</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> that did preſerve me out of their hands at <hi>Bristol,</hi> and over the Heads of all our <hi>Perſecutors;</hi> and the <hi>Lord</hi> alone is worthy of all the Glory, who did uphold and preſerve for his <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi>'s ſake.</p>
            <p>At <hi>London</hi> I ſtaid not long this time; but was drawn in my Spirit to viſit <hi>Friends Northward,</hi>

               </note> and the <hi>Maſter</hi> of the <hi>Houſe</hi> ſeemed to be troubled, that we ſhould go to <hi>Priſon:</hi> and being himſelf in <hi>Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> he ſent for <hi>Lawyers</hi> in the Town to adviſe with; and would have taken up the <hi>Mittimus,</hi> and kept us in his own Houſe, and not have let us gone into the <hi>Jail.</hi> But I told <hi>Friends,</hi> it would be great <hi>Charge</hi> to lie at an <hi>Inn,</hi> and many <hi>Friends</hi> and People would be coming to <hi>Viſit</hi> us; and it might be hard for him to bear our having <hi>Meetings</hi> in his Houſe: and beſides, we had many <hi>Friends</hi> in the <hi>Priſon</hi> already; and we had rather be with them. So we let the <hi>Man</hi> know, that we were ſenſible of his <hi>Kindneſs:</hi> and to <hi>Priſon</hi> we went;<note place="margin">Leiceſter-<hi>Priſon.</hi>
               </note> the <hi>Poor Man,</hi> that brought us thither, delivering both the <hi>Mittimus</hi> and us to the <hi>Jailer.</hi> This <hi>Jailer</hi> had been a very <hi>wicked, cruel Man:</hi> and there being <hi>Six</hi> or <hi>Seven Friends</hi> in <hi>Priſon,</hi> before we came, he had taken ſome occaſion to <hi>quarrel</hi> with them, and had thruſt them into the <hi>Dungeon</hi> amongſt the <hi>Fellons;</hi> where was hardly room for them to lie down, they were ſo thronged. We ſtay'd all that day in the <hi>Priſon-Yard,</hi> and deſired the <hi>Jailer</hi> to let us have ſome <hi>Straw:</hi> He ſurlily anſwered, <hi>You do not look like Men that would lie on Straw.</hi> After a while <hi>William Smith,</hi> a <hi>Friend,</hi> came to me; and he being acquainted in the Houſe, I asked him, What <hi>Rooms</hi> there were in the Houſe, and what <hi>Rooms Friends</hi> uſually had been put into, before they were put into the <hi>Dungeon?</hi> I asked him alſo, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Jailer</hi> or his <hi>Wife</hi> was <hi>Maſter?</hi> He ſaid, The <hi>Wife</hi> was <hi>Maſter;</hi> and that, though ſhe was <hi>Lame,</hi> and ſate moſtly in her <hi>Chair,</hi> not being able to go but on <hi>Crutches;</hi> yet ſhe would <hi>beat</hi> her <hi>Husband,</hi> when he came within her reach, if he did not do as ſhe would have him do. Now I conſidered, that probably many <hi>Friends</hi>
               <pb n="257" facs="tcp:51448:218"/> might come to Viſit us; and that,<note place="margin">1662. Leiceſter-Priſon.</note> if we had a <hi>Room</hi> to our ſelves, it would be better for them to ſpeak to me, and for me to ſpeak to them, as there ſhould be occaſion. Wherefore I deſired <hi>William Smith</hi> to go ſpeak with the <hi>Woman,</hi> and let her know, if ſhe would let us have a <hi>Room,</hi> and let our <hi>Friends</hi> come up out of the <hi>Dungeon;</hi> and leave it to us and them, to give her what we would, it might be better for her. He went: and after ſome reaſoning with her, ſhe conſented; and we were had into a <hi>Room.</hi> Then we were told, that the <hi>Jailer</hi> would not ſuffer us to fetch any <hi>Drink</hi> out of the <hi>Town</hi> into the <hi>Priſon;</hi> but that what <hi>Beer</hi> we drank, we muſt take of him. I told them, I would remedy that, if they would: for we would get a <hi>Pale</hi> of <hi>Water,</hi> and a little <hi>Wormwood once</hi> a <hi>day;</hi> and that might ſerve us: So we ſhould have none of his <hi>Beer;</hi> and the <hi>Water</hi> he could not deny us.</p>
            <p>Before we came there, when thoſe few <hi>Friends,</hi> that were <hi>Priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> there, did <hi>Meet</hi> together on the <hi>Firſt-Days,</hi> if any of them was moved to <hi>pray</hi> to the <hi>Lord,</hi> the <hi>Jailer</hi> would come up with his great <hi>Quarter-ſtaff</hi> in his Hand, and his <hi>Maſtiff-Dog</hi> at his Heels, and would pluck them down by the <hi>Hair</hi> of the <hi>Head,</hi> and ſtrike them with his <hi>Staff:</hi> but when he ſtruck <hi>Friends,</hi> the <hi>Maſtiff-Dog,</hi> inſtead of falling upon <hi>Friends,</hi> would take the <hi>Staff</hi> out of his Hand. Now when the <hi>Firſt-Day</hi> came, after we came in, I ſpake to one of my <hi>Fellow-Priſoners,</hi> to carry down a <hi>Stool,</hi> and ſet it in the <hi>Yard;</hi> and give notice to the <hi>Debtors</hi> and <hi>Fellons,</hi> that there would be a <hi>Meeting</hi> in the <hi>Yard;</hi> and they that would hear the <hi>Word</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, might come thither. So the <hi>Debtors</hi> and <hi>Priſoners</hi> went into the <hi>Yard,</hi> and we went down, and had a very precious <hi>Meeting:</hi> the <hi>Jailer</hi> not meddling. Thus every <hi>First-Day</hi> we had a <hi>Meeting</hi> there, as long as we ſtay'd in <hi>Priſon:</hi> and ſeveral came in out of the <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Country,</hi> and many were <hi>Convinced;</hi> and ſome received the <hi>Lord's Truth</hi> there, who ſtood <hi>faithful Witneſſes</hi> for it ever ſince.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Seſſions</hi> came, we were had up before the <hi>Juſtices;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Leiceſter-<hi>Seſſions.</hi>
               </note> with many more <hi>Friends,</hi> that were ſent to <hi>Priſon,</hi> whilſt we were there, to the number of about <hi>Twenty.</hi> Being brought into the Court, the <hi>Jailer</hi> put us into the Place, where the <hi>Thieves</hi> were put; and then ſome of the <hi>Juſtices</hi> began to tender the <hi>Oaths</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy</hi> to us. I told them: I never took any <hi>Oath</hi> in my Life; and they knew, we could not <hi>Swear,</hi> becauſe <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtle</hi> forbad it: and therefore they put it but as a <hi>Snare</hi> to us. But we told them, if they could prove, that after <hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid <hi>Swearing,</hi> they did ever command <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to <hi>Swear,</hi> then we would take theſe <hi>Oaths;</hi> otherwiſe we were reſolved, to obey <hi>Chriſt's Command,</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtle's</hi> Exhortation. They ſaid, <hi>We muſt take the</hi> Oath, <hi>that we might manifeſt our Allegiance to the King.</hi> I told them, I had been formerly ſent up a <hi>Priſoner</hi> by <hi>Col. Hacker,</hi> from that Town to <hi>London,</hi> under pretence, that I held <hi>Meetings</hi> to <hi>plot to bring in King</hi> Charles. I alſo deſired them to read our <hi>Mittimus,</hi> which ſet forth the Cauſe of our Commitment to be, that we were <hi>To have a Meeting;</hi> and I ſaid, he that was called <hi>Lord Beaumont,</hi> could not by that <hi>Act</hi> ſend us to <hi>Jail,</hi> unleſs we had been <hi>taken at a Meeting,</hi> and found to be ſuch <hi>Perſons,</hi> as the <hi>Act</hi> ſpeaks of: therefore we deſired,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:51448:219"/> they would read the <hi>Mittimus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1662. Leiceſter-<hi>Seſſions.</hi>
               </note> and ſee, how wrongfully we were <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned.</hi> They would not take notice of the <hi>Mittimus;</hi> but called a <hi>Jury,</hi> and Indicted us for <hi>Refuſing to take the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy.</hi> When the <hi>Jury</hi> was <hi>Sworn</hi> and <hi>Inſtructed,</hi> as they were going out, <hi>one,</hi> that had been an <hi>Alderman</hi> of the City, ſpake to them, and bid them <hi>Have a good Conſcience:</hi> and one of the <hi>Jury,</hi> being a peeviſh Man, told the <hi>Juſtices,</hi> There was <hi>One affronted the Jury:</hi> Whereupon they called him up, and tendred him the <hi>Oath</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; and he took it.</p>
            <p>While we were ſtanding in the <hi>Place,</hi> where the <hi>Thieves</hi> uſed to ſtand, there was a <hi>Cut-Purſe</hi> had his Hand in ſeveral <hi>Friends Pockets;</hi> and <hi>Friends</hi> declared it to the <hi>Juſtices,</hi> and ſhewed them the <hi>Man:</hi> They called him up before them; and upon Examination he could not deny it: yet they ſet him at <hi>Liberty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was not long, before the <hi>Jury Returned,</hi> and brought us in <hi>Guilty:</hi> and then, after ſome Words, the <hi>Juſtices Whiſpered</hi> together, and bid the <hi>Jailer</hi> take us down to <hi>Priſon</hi> again: But the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> was over them, and his Everlaſting <hi>Truth,</hi> which we declared boldly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them. And there being a great <hi>Concourſe</hi> of <hi>People,</hi> moſt of them followed us; ſo that the <hi>Cryer,</hi> and <hi>Bayliffs</hi> were ſain to call the <hi>People</hi> back again to the <hi>Court:</hi> We declared the <hi>Truth,</hi> as we went down the <hi>Streets</hi> all along,<note place="margin">Leiceſter-<hi>Jail.</hi>
               </note> till we came to the <hi>Jail,</hi> the <hi>Streets</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing full of <hi>People.</hi> When we were in our <hi>Chamber</hi> again, after ſome time the <hi>Jailer</hi> came to us, and deſired all to go forth, that were not <hi>Priſoners.</hi> And when they were gone, he ſaid, <hi>Gentlemen, it is the Court's Pleaſure, that ye ſhould all be ſet at liberty, except thoſe that are in for</hi> Tithes: <hi>and you know, there are</hi> Fees <hi>due to me; but I ſhall leave it to you, to give me what you will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus were we all ſet at <hi>Liberty</hi> on a ſudden. And being thus ſet at <hi>Liberty,</hi> the reſt paſſed every one into their <hi>Services;</hi> only <hi>Leonard Fell</hi> (being come thither) ſtay'd with me, and we <hi>two</hi> went again to <hi>Swanington.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Swaning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</note> I had a <hi>Letter</hi> from him they called the <hi>Lord Haſtings;</hi> who hearing of my <hi>Impriſonment,</hi> had written from <hi>London</hi> to the <hi>Justices</hi> at the <hi>Seſſions,</hi> to ſet me at <hi>Liberty.</hi> Now I had not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered this <hi>Letter</hi> to the <hi>Juſtices;</hi> but whether they had any knowledge of his Mind from any <hi>other hand,</hi> which made them diſcharge us ſo ſuddenly, I know not. But this <hi>Letter</hi> I carried to him called the <hi>Lord Beaumont,</hi> who had ſent us to <hi>Priſon;</hi> and when he had broken it open, and read it, he ſeemed much <hi>troubled:</hi> but at laſt came a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle lower; yet threatned us, if we had any more <hi>Meetings</hi> at <hi>Swa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nington,</hi> he would break them up, and ſend us to <hi>Priſon</hi> again. But notwithſtanding his <hi>Threats,</hi> we went to <hi>Swanington,</hi> and had a <hi>Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> with <hi>Friends</hi> there: and he came not, nor ſent not to break it up.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Swanington</hi> we paſſed through the Country, and came to a Place called <hi>Twy-Croſs;</hi>

Then he came to me again, and ſaid; <hi>I muſt go along with him to the Town;</hi> and he carried himſelf pretty civilly, bidding the <hi>Souldiers,</hi> bring the reſt after. As we walked, I asked him; <hi>Why they did thus?</hi> for I <hi>had not ſeen ſo much ado a great while:</hi> and I bid him be <hi>Civil</hi> to his <hi>Neighbours,</hi> who were <hi>peaceable.</hi> When we were come to the <hi>Town,</hi> they had us to an <hi>Inn,</hi> that was the <hi>Jailer's Houſe;</hi> and after a while the <hi>Major</hi> of the Town, and this <hi>Captain,</hi> and the <hi>Lieutenant,</hi> who were <hi>Juſtices,</hi> came together, and Examined me; <hi>Why I came thither to make a Diſturbance?</hi> I told them, I did not come to make a <hi>Diſturbance;</hi> neither had I made any <hi>Diſturbance,</hi> ſince I came. They ſaid, <hi>There was a</hi> Law, <hi>which was againſt the</hi> Quakers <hi>Meetings, made only against them.</hi> I told them, I knew no ſuch <hi>Law.</hi> Then they brought forth the <hi>Act,</hi> that was made againſt <hi>Quakers</hi> and others: I told them; That was againſt ſuch, as were a <hi>Terror to the King's Subjects, and were Enemies, and held dangerous Principles to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;</hi> and therefore that was not againſt us: for we held <hi>Truth,</hi> and our <hi>Principles</hi> were not dangerous to the <hi>Government,</hi> and our <hi>Meetings</hi> were peaceable, as they knew, who knew their Neighbours were a peaceable People. They told me, <hi>I was an Enemy to the King:</hi> I told them, We loved all People, and were Enemies to none: and that I, for my own part, had been caſt into <hi>Darby-Dungeon</hi> many years ago, about the time of <hi>Worceſter-Fight,</hi> becauſe I would not take up <hi>Arms</hi> againſt him; and that I was afterward brought up by <hi>Col.

They demanded <hi>Bond</hi> of us for our <hi>Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> at the <hi>Seſſions;</hi> but we pleading our <hi>Innocency,</hi> refuſed to give <hi>Bond.</hi> Then they would have had us <hi>promiſe to come no more there:</hi> But we kept clear of that alſo. When they ſaw, they could not bring

Robinſon,</hi> a very <hi>wicked Man,</hi> who after the <hi>King</hi> came in, was made a <hi>Juſtice</hi> of the <hi>Peace,</hi> and became a <hi>Cruel Perſecutor</hi> of our <hi>Friends;</hi> of whom he ſent many to <hi>Priſon.</hi> And hearing, that they had ſome little <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</hi> through the Favour of the <hi>Jailer,</hi> to come home ſometimes, to viſit their <hi>Wives</hi> and <hi>Children,</hi> he made a great <hi>Complaint</hi> thereof to the <hi>Judge</hi> at the <hi>Aſſize</hi> againſt the <hi>Jailer:</hi> Whereupon the <hi>Jailer</hi> was fined an <hi>Hundred Marks,</hi> and <hi>Friends</hi> were kept very <hi>ſtrictly</hi> up for a while. After he was come home from the <hi>Aſſize,</hi> he ſent to a Neighbouring <hi>Juſtice,</hi> to deſire them to go a <hi>Fanatick-hunting</hi> with him. So on the Day, that he intended and was prepared to go a <hi>Fanatick-hunting,</hi> he ſent his <hi>Man about</hi> with his <hi>Horſes,</hi> and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf on <hi>Foot</hi> from his <hi>Dwelling-Houſe</hi> to a <hi>Tenement,</hi> that he had, where his <hi>Cows</hi> and <hi>Dairy</hi> were kept, and where his <hi>Servants</hi> were then <hi>milking.</hi> When he came there, he asked for his <hi>Bull;</hi> and the <hi>Maid-Servants</hi> ſaid, They had ſhut him into the <hi>Field,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nruly</hi> amongſt the <hi>Kine,</hi> and hindred their <hi>Milking.</hi> Then went he into the <hi>Field</hi> to his <hi>Bull;</hi> and having formerly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed himſelf to <hi>play</hi> with the <hi>Bull,</hi> he began to <hi>fence</hi> at him with his <hi>Staff,</hi> as he uſed to do. But the <hi>Bull ſnufft</hi> at him, and paſſed a little back; and then turning upon him again, <hi>ran fiercely</hi> at him, and <hi>ſtruck</hi> his <hi>Horn</hi> into his <hi>Thigh,</hi> and heaving him upon his <hi>Horn,</hi> threw him over his <hi>Back,</hi> and ſo tore up his <hi>Thigh</hi> to his <hi>Belly.</hi> And when he came to the Ground again, he <hi>gored</hi> him with his <hi>Horns,</hi> and would run them into the <hi>Ground</hi> in his <hi>Rage</hi> and <hi>Violence;</hi> and <hi>roared,</hi> and <hi>licked</hi> up his Maſter's <hi>Blood.</hi> The <hi>Maid-Servant</hi> hearing her <hi>Maſter</hi> Cry out, came running into the <hi>Field,</hi> and came to the <hi>Bull,</hi> and took him by the <hi>Horns,</hi> to pull him off from her <hi>Maſter.</hi> The <hi>Bull,</hi> without hurting her, put her
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:51448:222"/> gently by with his <hi>Horns;</hi> but ſtill fell to <hi>goring</hi> of him,<note place="margin">1663. Cornwal.</note> and <hi>licking up</hi> his <hi>Blood.</hi> Then ſhe ran, and got ſome <hi>Work-men,</hi> that were at Work not far off, to come in and reſcue her <hi>Maſter:</hi> but they could not at all <hi>beat off</hi> the <hi>Bull,</hi> till they brought <hi>Maſtiff-Dogs</hi> to ſet on him; and then the <hi>Bull fled</hi> in a great <hi>Rage</hi> and <hi>Fury.</hi> Upon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it his <hi>Siſter</hi> came, and ſaid to him; <hi>Alack</hi> Brother, <hi>what a heavy Judgment is this, that is befallen you!</hi> And he Anſwered, <hi>Ah,</hi> Siſter, <hi>It is an heavy Judgment indeed:</hi> Pray let the <hi>Bull</hi> be <hi>killed,</hi> and the <hi>Fleſh</hi> given to the <hi>Poor,</hi> ſaid he. So they carried him home; but he <hi>died</hi> ſoon after. And the <hi>Bull</hi> was grown ſo <hi>fierce,</hi> that they were forced to <hi>ſhoot</hi> him with <hi>Guns:</hi> for no Man durſt come near him, to <hi>kill</hi> him. Thus does the <hi>Lord</hi> ſometimes make ſome <hi>Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> of his <hi>juſt Judgment</hi> upon the <hi>Perſecutors</hi> of his People, that others may <hi>fear,</hi> and learn to beware.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now after I had cleared my ſelf of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Lower</hi> (who had rid with us from <hi>Meeting</hi> to <hi>Meeting</hi> through that <hi>County</hi>) had brought us over <hi>Horſe-bridge</hi> into <hi>Devonſhire</hi> again,<note place="margin">Horſe-bridge. <hi>Devonſhire</hi>
               </note> we took our leave of him. And <hi>Thomas Briggs, Robert Widders</hi> and I came through the Country to <hi>Tiverton:</hi> and it being their <hi>Fair,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tiverton.</note> and many <hi>Friends</hi> there, we had a <hi>Meeting</hi> amongſt them; and the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Street,</hi> but the Lord's Power ſtopt them: I ſaw them in the <hi>Street</hi> over againſt the <hi>Door;</hi> but they had not <hi>Power</hi> to come in to meddle with us, though they had <hi>Will</hi> enough to have done it.</p>
            <p>After the <hi>Meeting</hi> was done,<note place="margin">Collum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pton.

There had been very great <hi>Perſecution</hi> in that <hi>Country,</hi> and in that <hi>Town</hi> a little before, inſomuch that ſome <hi>Friends</hi> queſtioned the <hi>Peaceableneſs</hi> of our <hi>Meeting;</hi> but the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> chained all, and his <hi>Glory</hi> ſhined over all. The <hi>Friends</hi> told us, how they had broken up their <hi>Meetings</hi> by <hi>Warrants</hi> from the <hi>Juſtices,</hi> and how by their <hi>Warrants</hi> they were required to carry <hi>Friends</hi> before the <hi>Juſtices;</hi> and <hi>Friends</hi> bid them, <hi>Carry them then.</hi> The <hi>Officers</hi> told <hi>Friends,</hi> they muſt <hi>Go:</hi> but <hi>Friends</hi> ſaid <hi>Nay,</hi> that was not according to their <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants,</hi> which required them to <hi>Carry them.</hi> Then they were fain to hire <hi>Carts</hi> and <hi>Wagons,</hi> and <hi>Horſes,</hi> and to lift <hi>Friends</hi> up into their <hi>Wagons</hi> and <hi>Carts,</hi> to carry them before a <hi>Juſtice.</hi> And when they came to a <hi>Juſtice's Houſe,</hi> ſometimes he happened to be <hi>from home:</hi> and if he were a <hi>Moderate Man,</hi> he would get out of the way; and then they were forced to <hi>Carry</hi> them before another: So that they were <hi>Many Days Carting</hi> and <hi>Carrying Friends up and down from place to place.</hi> And when afterward the <hi>Officers</hi> came to lay their <hi>Charges</hi> for this upon the <hi>Town,</hi> the <hi>Town's People</hi> would not <hi>pay</hi> it; but made them bear it themſelves: and that brake the <hi>Neck</hi> of their <hi>Perſecution</hi> there for that time. The like was done in ſeveral other places, till the <hi>Officers</hi> had <hi>ſhamed</hi> and <hi>tired</hi> themſelves; and then were fain to give over.</p>
            <pb n="266" facs="tcp:51448:223"/>
            <p>At one place they warned <hi>Friends</hi> to come to the <hi>Steeple-houſe;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1663. Welling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</note> and the <hi>Friends</hi> met together to conſider of it; and had freedom to go to the <hi>Steeple-houſe,</hi> and <hi>Meet together</hi> there. Accordingly when they came thither, they ſate down together, to <hi>Wait upon the</hi> Lord <hi>in his Power and Spirit, and minded the</hi> Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>their Teacher and Saviour;</hi> but did not mind the <hi>Prieſt.</hi> When the <hi>Officers</hi> ſaw that, they came to them to put them out of the <hi>Steeple-houſe</hi> again; but the <hi>Friends</hi> told them, it was not time for them to <hi>break up</hi> their <hi>Meeting</hi> yet. A while after, when the <hi>Prieſt</hi> had done his <hi>Stuff,</hi> they came to the <hi>Friends</hi> again, and would have had them go home to <hi>Dinner;</hi> but the <hi>Friends</hi> told them: They did not uſe to go to <hi>Dinner;</hi> but were feeding upon the <hi>Bread</hi> of <hi>Life.</hi> So there they ſate, <hi>Waiting upon the Lord,</hi> and enjoying his Power and Preſence, till they found <hi>Freedom</hi> in themſelves to depart. Thus the <hi>Prieſt's People</hi> were <hi>offended,</hi> becauſe they could not get them to the <hi>Steeple-houſe:</hi> and when they were there, they were <hi>offended,</hi> becauſe they could not get them <hi>out again.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Then ſaid <hi>George Middleton,</hi> You <hi>deny God, and the Church,</hi> and the true <hi>Faith.</hi> I replied, <q>Nay: I own <hi>God,</hi> and the true <hi>Church,</hi> and the true <hi>Faith.</hi> But what <hi>Church</hi> doſt thou own, ſaid I?

Did you ever hear the like,</hi> ſaid <hi>Middleton?</hi> 'Nay, ſaid I, ye may <hi>hear</hi> it again, if ye will.

                  <hi>Nay;</hi> for I and my <hi>Friends</hi> direct all the People to the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in them, to mortifie the <hi>Deeds</hi> of the <hi>Fleſh:</hi> This brings them into the <hi>Well-doing,</hi> and from that which the <hi>Magiſtrate's Sword</hi> is againſt; which <hi>eaſes</hi> the <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> who are for the <hi>Puniſhment</hi> of the <hi>Evil-Doers.</hi> So

            <p>Then <hi>Geo Middleton</hi> cried, <hi>Bring the Book, and put the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy to him.</hi> Now he himſelf being a <hi>Papist,</hi> I asked him, <q>
                  <hi>Whether he had taken the</hi> Oath <hi>of</hi> Supremacy, <hi>who was a Swearer?</hi> But as for us, we could not <hi>Swear at all,</hi> becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> had <hi>forbidden</hi> it.</q> Some of them would not have had the <hi>Oath</hi> put to me; but have let me have my <hi>Liberty:</hi> but the reſt would not agree to that: For this was their laſt <hi>Snare,</hi> and they had no other way to get me into <hi>Priſon;</hi> for all other things had been cleared to them. But this was like the <hi>Papiſts Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Altar,</hi> by which they <hi>enſnared</hi> the <hi>Martyrs.</hi> So they tendered me the <hi>Oath,</hi> and I could not take it: Whereupon they were about to make my <hi>Mittimus,</hi> to ſend me to <hi>Lancaſter-Jail:</hi> But conſidering to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of it, they only engaged me to <hi>Appear</hi> at the <hi>Seſſions;</hi> and ſo for that time diſmiſt me.

            </p>
            <p>Now whilſt I was at <hi>Swarthmore,</hi> there came <hi>William Kirby</hi> into <hi>Swarthmore-Meeting,</hi> and brought the <hi>Conſtables</hi> with him.

Yes,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>we do meet to Wait upon the Lord.</hi> So he began to take the <hi>Names</hi> of <hi>Friends;</hi> and them that did not readily tell him their <hi>Names,</hi> he committed to the <hi>Conſtables</hi> hands, and ſent ſome to <hi>Priſon.</hi> The <hi>Conſtables</hi> were unwilling to take them without a <hi>Warrant;</hi> whereupon he threatned to <hi>ſet them by the Heels:</hi> But the <hi>Conſtable</hi> told him; <hi>He could keep them in his Preſence; but after he was gone, he could not keep them without a</hi> Warrant.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Seſſions</hi> now coming on, I went to <hi>Lancaſter,</hi>

               <hi>Well,</hi> ſaid the <hi>Judge,</hi> George Fox <hi>ſay, Whether thou wilt take the</hi> Oath, <hi>Yea or Nay?</hi> I replied, <q>I ſay, as I ſaid before, Whether ought I to obey <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Man,</hi> Judge thou? 'If I could take any <hi>Oath</hi> at all, I ſhould take this: for I do not deny <hi>ſome Oaths</hi> only, or <hi>on ſome Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion;</hi> but <hi>all Oaths,</hi> according to Chriſt's Doctrine, who hath commanded his, <hi>Not to ſwear at all.</hi> Now if thou, or any of you, or any of your <hi>Miniſters</hi> or <hi>Prieſts</hi> here will prove, that ever <hi>Chriſt</hi> or his <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> after they had forbidden all <hi>Swearing,</hi> commanded <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to <hi>Swear,</hi> then I will <hi>Swear.</hi>
               </q> I ſaw ſeveral <hi>Prieſts</hi> there; but never an one of them offered to ſpeak. Then ſaid the <hi>Judge, I am
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:51448:229"/> a Servant to the</hi> King, <hi>and the</hi> King <hi>ſent me not to diſpute with you, but to put the</hi> Laws <hi>in Execution: Therefore tender him the</hi> Oath <hi>of</hi> Allegiance. <q>If thou love the <hi>King,</hi> ſaid I, why doſt thou break his <hi>Word,</hi> and not keep his <hi>Declarations</hi> and <hi>Speeches,</hi> wherein he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed <hi>Liberty</hi> to <hi>Tender Conſciences?</hi> I am a Man of a <hi>tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience;</hi> and in obedience to <hi>Chriſt's Command</hi> I cannot <hi>Swear.</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>Then you will not Swear,</hi> ſaid the <hi>Judge: Take him away,</hi> Jailer. I ſaid, <q>It is for <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s ſake, that I cannot <hi>Swear,</hi> and for Obedience to his Command I <hi>Suffer;</hi> and ſo the <hi>Lord</hi> forgive you all.</q> So the <hi>Jailer</hi> took me away: but I felt, the mighty <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> was over them all.</p>
            <p>Upon the <hi>Sixteenth Day</hi> of the <hi>ſame Month</hi> I was brought before <hi>Judge Twiſden</hi> again, and he was ſomewhat offended at my <hi>Hat;</hi> but it being the laſt Morning of the <hi>Aſſize,</hi> before he was to go out of Town, and not many People there, he made the leſs of it. He asked me, <hi>Whether I would Traverſe, or ſtand Mute, or Submit?</hi> But he ſpake ſo faſt, and in ſuch haſte, that it was hard to know, what he ſaid. However, I told him, <q>I deſired, I might have Liberty to <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe</hi> the <hi>Indictment,</hi> and <hi>Try</hi> it.</q> Then ſaid he, <hi>Take him away, I will have nothing to do with him, take him away.</hi> I ſaid, <q>Well, live in the <hi>Fear</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and do <hi>Juſtice.</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>Why,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>have not I done you Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice?</hi> I replied, <q>That which thou haſt done, hath been againſt the <hi>Command</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lancaſter-<hi>Priſon.</hi>
                  </note>
               </q> So I was taken away, and had to the <hi>Jail</hi> again; and there kept <hi>Priſoner,</hi> till the next <hi>Aſſizes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sometime before this <hi>Aſſize, Margaret Fell</hi> was ſent <hi>Priſoner</hi> to <hi>Lancaſter-Jail</hi> by <hi>Flemming, Kirby</hi> and <hi>Preſton</hi> Juſtices; and at the <hi>Aſſize</hi> the <hi>Oath</hi> was tendered to her alſo, and ſhe was committed again to <hi>Priſon,</hi> to lie till the <hi>next Aſſize.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now <hi>Juſtice Flemming</hi> being one of the fierceſt and moſt-violent <hi>Juſtices</hi> in <hi>Perſecuting Friends,</hi> and ſending his honeſt <hi>Neighbours</hi> to <hi>Priſon</hi> for <hi>Religion's</hi> ſake; and there being many <hi>Friends</hi> at this time in <hi>Lancaſter-Jail</hi> committed thither by him, and ſome having <hi>died in Priſon;</hi> we that were then <hi>Priſoners,</hi> had it upon us to write to him, as followeth.</p>

            <p>When I was <hi>Priſoner</hi> at <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> there was <hi>Priſoner</hi> alſo one <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor Wiggan,</hi> a <hi>Baptiſt-Preacher.</hi> He boaſted much before-hand, what he would ſay at the <hi>Aſſize,</hi> if the <hi>Oath</hi> ſhould be put to him; and that he would <hi>refuſe</hi> to <hi>Swear.</hi> But when the <hi>Aſſize</hi> came, and the <hi>Oath</hi> was tendered him, he deſired <hi>Time</hi> to conſider of it: and that being granted him, till the next <hi>Aſſize;</hi> he got leave to go to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> before the <hi>Aſſize</hi> came again: and came no more back, but ſtaid at <hi>London,</hi> till the <hi>Plague</hi> brake forth: and there both <hi>he</hi> and his <hi>Wife</hi> were <hi>Cut off.</hi> He was a very <hi>Wicked Man,</hi> and the <hi>Judgments</hi> of <hi>God</hi> came upon him: For he had publiſhed a very <hi>wicked Book</hi> againſt <hi>Friends,</hi> full of <hi>Lies</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemies;</hi> the <hi>Occaſion</hi> of which was this. Whilſt he was in <hi>Lancaſter-Caſtle,</hi> he challenged <hi>Friends</hi> to have a <hi>Diſpute</hi> with them: Whereupon I got leave of the <hi>Jailer</hi> to go up to them. And entring into Diſcourſe with him, he affirmed: <hi>That ſome Men never had the Spirit of God; and that the true Light, which enlightneth every one, that cometh into the world, is natural.</hi> For <hi>Proof</hi> of his <hi>firſt Aſſertion,</hi> he inſtanced <hi>Balaam,</hi> affirming; <hi>That</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam <hi>had not the Spirit of God.</hi> I affirmed and proved, <q>That <hi>Bala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> had the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> and that <hi>Wicked Men</hi> have the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> elſe how could they <hi>quench</hi> it, and <hi>vex</hi> it, and <hi>grieve</hi> it, and <hi>reſiſt</hi> the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> like the ſtiff-necked <hi>Jews?</hi>
               </q> To his <hi>Second Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion</hi> I anſwered; <q>That the true <hi>Light,</hi> which enlightneth every Man, that cometh into the World, was the <hi>Life</hi> in the <hi>Word;</hi> and that was <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Eternal,</hi> and not <hi>Natural.</hi> And he might as well ſay, that the <hi>Word</hi> was <hi>Natural,</hi> as that the <hi>Life</hi> in the <hi>Word</hi> was <hi>Natural.</hi> And <hi>Wicked Men</hi> were enlightned by this <hi>Light,</hi> elſe how could they <hi>hate it?</hi> Now it is expreſly ſaid, that they did <hi>hate</hi> it: And the Reaſon given, why they did <hi>hate</hi> it, was, <hi>becauſe their Deeds were evil;</hi> and they would not <hi>come to</hi> it, becauſe it <hi>reproved</hi> them: and that muſt needs be <hi>in them,</hi> that <hi>reproved</hi> them. Beſides, that <hi>Light</hi> could not be the <hi>Scriptures</hi> of the <hi>New-Teſtament;</hi> for it was teſtified of, before any part of the <hi>New-Teſtament</hi> was written: So it muſt be the <hi>Divine Light,</hi> which is the <hi>Life</hi> in <hi>Christ</hi> the <hi>Word,</hi> before <hi>Scriptures</hi> were. And the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which brought Salvation, had appeared unto all Men; and <hi>taught</hi> the <hi>Saints:</hi> but they that turned it into Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs, and walked deſpitefully againſt the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> were the <hi>Wicked.</hi> Again, the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> the <hi>Comforter,</hi> which <hi>leads</hi> the <hi>Diſciples of Christ into all Truth;</hi>
                  <pb n="282" facs="tcp:51448:231"/> the ſame ſhould <hi>Reprove the World of Sin, of Righteouſneſs, and of Judgment,</hi> and of their <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief.</hi> So the <hi>Wicked World</hi> had it to <hi>reprove</hi> them; and the true <hi>Diſciples</hi> and Learners of Chriſt, that believed in the <hi>Light,</hi> as Chriſt commands, they had it to <hi>lead</hi> them. But the <hi>World,</hi> that did not believe in the <hi>Light,</hi> though they were lighted; but <hi>hated</hi> the <hi>Light,</hi> which they ſhould have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in, and loved the Darkneſs rather than it, this <hi>World</hi> had a <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> and a <hi>Judgment,</hi> which the Holy Ghoſt <hi>reproved</hi> them for, as well as for their <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief.</hi>
               </q> So having proved, that the <hi>Good</hi> and the <hi>Bad</hi> were enlightned, and that the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>God</hi> had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared unto them all, and that all had the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> elſe they could not <hi>vex</hi> and <hi>grieve</hi> it; I told <hi>Major Wiggan,</hi> The <hi>leaſt Babe</hi> there might <hi>ſee him:</hi> and preſently ſtood up one <hi>Richard Cubham,</hi> and proved him an <hi>Anti-chriſt,</hi> and a <hi>Deceiver,</hi> by <hi>Scripture.</hi> Then the <hi>Jailer</hi> had me away to my <hi>Priſon</hi> again. And afterwards <hi>Wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> wrote a <hi>Book</hi> of this <hi>Diſpute,</hi> and put in abundance of abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Lies:</hi> But his <hi>Book</hi> was ſoon <hi>Anſwered</hi> in <hi>Print;</hi> and he himſelf not long after was <hi>cut off,</hi> as afore is ſaid.</p>

                           <p>So likewiſe in the <hi>Rebellion</hi> of <hi>Corah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> where <hi>Moſes</hi> called them to <hi>Trial,</hi> he did not <hi>Sirrah</hi> them, or <hi>miſ-call</hi> them; but ſaid to <hi>Corah</hi> and the reſt, <hi>Hear, I pray you, ye Sons of</hi> Levi, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.8.

                           <p>When the <hi>

And when <hi>Paul</hi> was brought <hi>Priſoner</hi> before the <hi>High-Prieſt Ananias,</hi> and the <hi>Council</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and told them, <hi>He had lived in all good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience towards God, until that day;</hi> though they (who profeſſed the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> but lived out of the <hi>Life</hi> of them) could not abide to hear of <hi>Living in a good Conſcience</hi> (as <hi>Profeſſors</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> now, that live not in the <hi>Life,</hi> cannot abide to hear of <hi>living in a good Conſcience</hi> now-a-days:) But <hi>Ananias</hi> cauſed <hi>Paul</hi> to be <hi>ſmitten on the Mouth;</hi> yet he did not call him <hi>Knave,</hi> nor <hi>Sirrah, Acts</hi> 23. The <hi>Apoſtate-Jews</hi> indeed, (who, though they profeſſed <hi>Scripture,</hi> were out of the <hi>Life</hi> thereof, and had rejected <hi>Chriſt</hi>) in their accuſing <hi>Paul</hi> before the <hi>Roman Magiſtrates,</hi> did once call him a <hi>Peſtilent Fellow, Acts</hi> 24. as the Accuſing <hi>Profeſſors,</hi> who live out of the <hi>Life,</hi> will ſometimes call us now.

               </q> The <hi>Judge</hi> ſeemed not to take notice of my Anſwer; but asked me: <hi>Whether or no I had not refuſed to take the</hi> Oath <hi>at the laſt</hi> Aſſize?

               </q> The <hi>Judge</hi> ſaid, <hi>He was not at that time to diſpute, whether it was lawful to</hi> Swear; <hi>but to Inquire, whether I had refuſed to take the</hi> Oath, <hi>or no.</hi> I told him, <q>

               </q> So the <hi>Jury</hi> brought me in <hi>Guilty.</hi> Whereupon I told them, <q>That both the <hi>Juſtices,</hi> and <hi>they</hi> too had <hi>forſworn</hi> themſelves; and therefore they had ſmall cauſe to <hi>laugh,</hi> as they did a little before.</q> Oh the <hi>Envy,</hi> and <hi>Rage,</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,</hi> that was there againſt me, and the <hi>Lightneſs!</hi> But the <hi>Lord</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded them, and they were wonderfully ſtopt. So they ſet me aſide; and called up <hi>Margaret Fell,</hi> who had a great deal of <hi>good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi> amongſt them: and then the <hi>Court</hi> brake up near the <hi>Second Hour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>Afternoon</hi> we were brought up again, to have <hi>Sentence</hi> paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon us: And <hi>Margaret Fell</hi> deſired, that <hi>Sentence</hi> might be deferred, till the <hi>next Morning.</hi> 
               <q>I deſired nothing, but <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> at his hands; for the <hi>Thieves</hi> had <hi>Mercy:</hi> Only I deſired the <hi>Judge,</hi> to ſend ſome to ſee my <hi>Priſon;</hi> which was ſo <hi>bad,</hi> they would put no Creature they had, in it: and I told him, that <hi>Col.

               </q> The <hi>Judge ſhook</hi> his <hi>Head,</hi> and ſaid; <hi>When the</hi> Sentence <hi>was given, he would leave me to the favour of the Jailer.</hi> Now moſt of the <hi>Gentry</hi> of the <hi>Country</hi> were gathered together, expecting to hear the <hi>Sentence;</hi> and the <hi>Noiſe</hi> among the People was, <hi>That I ſhould be Tranſported.</hi> But they were all croſſed at that time: for the <hi>Sentence</hi> being deferred, till <hi>next Morning;</hi> I was had back, as I came, to <hi>Priſon</hi> again. Upon my complaining of the <hi>badneſs</hi> of my <hi>Priſon,</hi> ſome of the <hi>Juſtices,</hi> with <hi>Col.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Next day,</hi> towards the <hi>Eleventh Hour,</hi> we were called forth again to <hi>hear</hi> the <hi>Sentence:</hi> And <hi>Margaret Fell</hi> being called <hi>first</hi> to the <hi>Bar,</hi> ſhe had ſome <hi>Counſels</hi> to <hi>plead;</hi> who found many <hi>Errors</hi> in her <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment:</hi> Whereupon, after the <hi>Judge</hi> had acknowledged them, ſhe was ſet by. Then the <hi>Judge</hi> asked, <hi>What they could ſay to mine?</hi> Now
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:51448:235"/> I was not willing to let any Man <hi>plead</hi> for me; but to ſpeak to it my ſelf: And indeed, though <hi>Margaret</hi> had ſome, that <hi>pleaded</hi> for her: yet ſhe <hi>ſpake as much her ſelf, as ſhe would.</hi> But before I came to the <hi>Bar,</hi> I was moved in my <hi>Spirit</hi> to <hi>pray,</hi> 
               <q>That God would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found their <hi>Wickedneſs</hi> and <hi>Envy,</hi> and ſet his <hi>Truth</hi> over all; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt his <hi>Seed.</hi>
               </q> And the Lord heard and anſwered, and did <hi>Confound</hi> them in their Proceedings againſt me. And though they had moſt <hi>Envy</hi> againſt me; yet the <hi>moſt-groſs Errors</hi> were found in my <hi>Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, I having put by others from <hi>pleading</hi> for me, the <hi>Judge</hi> asked me; <hi>What I had to ſay, why he ſhould not paſs Sentence upon me.</hi> I told him, <q>I was no <hi>Lawyer;</hi> but I had much to ſay, if he would but have <hi>Patience</hi> to hear.</q> At that he <hi>laughed,</hi> and others <hi>laughed</hi> alſo, and ſaid; <hi>Come, what have you to ſay? He can ſay nothing. 'Yes,</hi> ſaid I, I have much to ſay: have but the <hi>Patience</hi> to hear me.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Then I asked him,</hi> Whether the <hi>Oath</hi> was to be tendred to the <hi>King</hi>'s Subjects, or to the Subjects of <hi>Forreign Princes?</hi>
               </q> He ſaid, <hi>To the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of this Realm.</hi> Then ſaid I, <q>Look the <hi>Indictment,</hi> and ye may ſee, that ye have left out the Word <hi>Subject:</hi> ſo not having named me in the <hi>Indictment,</hi> as a <hi>Subject,</hi> ye cannot <hi>Premunire</hi> me for not taking the <hi>Oath.</hi>
               </q> Then they looked the <hi>Statute,</hi> and the <hi>Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and ſaw, that it was, as I ſaid: and the <hi>Judge</hi> confeſſed, it was an <hi>Error.</hi> I told him, <q>I had ſomething elſe to ſtop his <hi>Judgment.</hi> And I deſired him to look, <hi>What day</hi> the <hi>Indictment</hi> ſaid the <hi>Oath</hi> was tendered to me at the <hi>Seſſions</hi> there?</q> They lookt, and ſaid, <hi>It was the</hi> Eleventh <hi>day of</hi> January. <q>What <hi>Day</hi> of the <hi>Week</hi> was that <hi>Seſſion</hi> held on, ſaid I? On a <hi>Tueſday,</hi> ſaid they.

               <q>Look ye now, ſaid I; ye have Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me for refuſing the <hi>Oath</hi> in the <hi>Quarter-Seſſions</hi> held at <hi>Lancaſter</hi> on the <hi>Eleventh Day</hi> of <hi>January</hi> laſt, and the <hi>Juſtices</hi> have <hi>Sworn,</hi> that they tendered me the <hi>Oath</hi> in open <hi>Seſſions</hi> here <hi>that day;</hi> and the <hi>Jury</hi> upon their <hi>Oaths</hi> have found me <hi>Guilty</hi> thereupon: and yet ye ſee, there was no <hi>Seſſion</hi> held in <hi>Lancaſter that day.</hi>
               </q> Then the <hi>Judge,</hi> to have covered the matter, asked, <hi>Whether the</hi> Seſſions <hi>did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin on the Eleventh day?</hi> But ſome in the <hi>Court</hi> Anſwered, <hi>No; The</hi> Seſſion <hi>held but one day, and that was the</hi> Twelfth. Then the <hi>Judge</hi> ſaid, <hi>This was a great Miſtake, and an Error.</hi> Some of the <hi>Juſtices</hi> were in a great <hi>Rage</hi> at this, and were ready to have gone off the <hi>Bench,</hi> and <hi>ſtampt,</hi> and ſaid; <hi>Who hath done this? Some body hath done it on purpoſe:</hi> and a great Heat was amongſt them. Then ſaid I, <q>Are not the <hi>Juſtices</hi> here, that have <hi>Sworn</hi> to this <hi>Indictment, forſworn Men</hi> in the <hi>face</hi> of the <hi>Country?</hi> But this is not all, ſaid I; I have more yet to offer, why <hi>Sentence</hi> ſhould not be given againſt me. Then I asked; 'In what <hi>Year</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> the laſt <hi>Aſſize</hi> here was holden, which was in the <hi>Month</hi> called <hi>March</hi> laſt?</q> And the <hi>Judge</hi> ſaid, <hi>It was in the Sixteenth Year of the King.</hi> 
               <q>But, ſaid I, the <hi>Indictment</hi> ſays, It was in the <hi>Fifteenth Year:</hi> and they looked,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:51448:235"/> and found it ſo.</q> This alſo was acknowledged to be another <hi>Error.</hi> But then they were all in a <hi>Fret</hi> again, both <hi>Judge</hi> and <hi>Juſtices,</hi> and could not tell, what to ſay: For the <hi>Judge</hi> had <hi>ſworn</hi> the <hi>Officers</hi> of the <hi>Court,</hi> that the <hi>Oath</hi> was tendered to me at the <hi>Aſſize</hi> mentioned in the <hi>Indictment.</hi> 'Now, ſaid I, Is not the <hi>Court</hi> here <hi>forſworn</hi> alſo, who have <hi>ſworn,</hi> that the <hi>Oath</hi> was tendered to me at the <hi>Aſſize</hi> hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den here in the <hi>Fifteenth Year</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> when-as it was in his <hi>Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Year;</hi> and ſo they have <hi>ſworn a whole Year falſe?</hi> The <hi>Judge</hi> bid them <hi>Look, whether</hi> Margaret Fell<hi>'s Indictment was ſo, or no?</hi> And they lookt; and found, it was not ſo. I told the <hi>Judge,</hi> 
               <q>I had more yet to offer, to ſtop <hi>Sentence:</hi> And I asked him; 'Whether <hi>All the Oath</hi> ought to be put into the <hi>Indictment,</hi> or no? <hi>Yes,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>it ought to be All put in.</hi> Then ſaid I, 'Compare the <hi>Indictment</hi> with the <hi>Oath,</hi> and there thou may'ſt ſee theſe Words, <hi>viz. [or by any Authority derived, or pretended to be derived from him, or his Sea]</hi> left out of the <hi>Indictment;</hi> which is a <hi>principal part</hi> of the <hi>Oath:</hi> And in another place the Words <hi>[Heirs and Succeſſors]</hi> are left out.</q> The <hi>Judge</hi> did acknowledge theſe alſo to be <hi>great Errors.</hi> But ſaid I, I have not yet done; I have yet ſomething further to alledg. <hi>Nay,</hi> ſaid the <hi>Judge, I have enough; you need ſay no more.</hi> 
               <q>If (ſaid I) thou haſt enough, I deſire nothing but <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> at thy hands: for I don't look for <hi>Mercy.</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>You muſt have</hi> Juſtice, ſaid he, <hi>and you ſhall have</hi> Law. Then I asked, <q>Am I at Liberty, and free from all, that ever hath been done againſt me in this matter?</q> 
               <hi>Yes,</hi> ſaid the <hi>Judge, You are free from all that hath been done against you. But then,</hi> ſtarting up in a <hi>Rage,</hi> he ſaid; <hi>I can put the Oath to any man here: and I will tender you the</hi> Oath <hi>again.</hi> I told him, <q>He had <hi>Examples</hi> enough yeſterday of <hi>Swearing</hi> and <hi>Falſe-ſwearing,</hi> both in the <hi>Juſtices</hi> and in the <hi>Jury:</hi> For I ſaw before mine Eyes, that both <hi>Juſtices</hi> and <hi>Jury</hi> had forſworn themſelves.</q> The <hi>Judge</hi> asked me, <hi>If I would take the</hi> Oath? I bid him, <q>Do me <hi>Juſtice</hi> for my <hi>falſe Impriſonment</hi> all this while: For what had I been <hi>Impriſoned</hi> ſo long for? And I told him, I ought to be ſet at <hi>Liberty.</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>You are at Liberty,</hi> ſaid he; <hi>but I will put the</hi> Oath <hi>to you again.</hi> Then I turned me about, and ſaid; <q>All People, take notice, this is a <hi>Snare:</hi> for I ought to be ſet <hi>free</hi> from the <hi>Jailer,</hi> and from this <hi>Court.</hi>
               </q> But the <hi>Judge</hi> cried, <hi>Give him the Book:</hi> and the <hi>Sheriff,</hi> and the <hi>Juſtices,</hi> cried, <hi>Give him the Book.</hi> Then the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Darkneſs</hi> roſe up in them, like a <hi>Mountain:</hi> and a <hi>Clerk</hi> lift up a <hi>Book</hi> to me. I ſtood ſtill, and ſaid, <q>If it be a <hi>Bible,</hi> give it me into my hand.</q> 
               <hi>Yes, yes,</hi> ſaid the <hi>Judge</hi> and <hi>Juſtices, give it him into his hand.</hi> So I took it, and lookt in it, and ſaid, 'I ſee, it is a <hi>Bible;</hi> I am glad of it. Now he had cauſed the <hi>Jury</hi> to be called, and they ſtood by (for after they had brought in their <hi>former Verdict,</hi> he would not diſmiſs them, though they deſired it; but told them, <hi>He could not diſmiſs them yet; for he ſhould have buſineſs for them: and therefore they muſt attend, and be ready, when they were called.</hi> And when he ſaid ſo, I felt his Intent, that if I was <hi>freed,</hi> he would come on again.) So I looked him in the <hi>Face;</hi> and the <hi>Witneſs</hi> of <hi>God</hi> ſtarted up in him, and made him <hi>bluſh,</hi> when he looked at me again: for he ſaw, that I <hi>ſaw</hi> him. Nevertheleſs <hi>har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening</hi> himſelf, he cauſed the <hi>Oath</hi> to be <hi>read</hi> to me, the <hi>Jury</hi> ſtanding
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:51448:236"/> by: And when it was read, he asked me, <hi>Whether I would take the</hi> Oath, <hi>or no?</hi> Then ſaid I, <q>Ye have given me a <hi>Book</hi> here to <hi>kiſs,</hi> and to <hi>ſwear</hi> on; and this <hi>Book,</hi> which ye have given me to <hi>kiſs,</hi> ſays, <hi>Kiſs the Son;</hi> and the <hi>Son</hi> ſays in this <hi>Book, Swear not at all:</hi> and ſo ſays alſo the <hi>Apoſtle James.</hi> Now (ſaid I) I ſay as the <hi>Book</hi> ſays; and yet ye <hi>Impriſon</hi> me: How chance, ye do not <hi>Impriſon</hi> the <hi>Book</hi> for ſaying ſo? How comes it, that the <hi>Book</hi> is at <hi>Liberty</hi> amongſt you, which bids me <hi>not ſwear;</hi> and yet ye <hi>Impriſon</hi> me, for doing as the <hi>Book</hi> bids me?</q> Why don't ye <hi>Impriſon</hi> the <hi>Book?</hi> Now as I was ſpeaking this to them, and held up the <hi>Bible</hi> open in my hand, to ſhew them the place in the <hi>Book,</hi> where <hi>Christ forbid ſwearing,</hi> they pluckt the <hi>Book</hi> out of my hand again; and the <hi>Judge</hi> ſaid, <hi>Nay, but we will Impriſon</hi> George Fox. Yet this got abroad over all the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> as a <hi>By word, That they gave me a Book to ſwear on, that comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me,</hi> Not to ſwear at all; <hi>and that the</hi> Bible <hi>was at</hi> Liberty, <hi>and I in</hi> Priſon, <hi>for doing as the</hi> Bible <hi>ſaid.</hi> Now when the <hi>Judge</hi> ſtill ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged me to <hi>Swear,</hi> I told him, <q>I never took <hi>Oath, Covenant</hi> nor <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement</hi> in my Life; but my <hi>Yea</hi> or <hi>Nay</hi> was more binding to me, than an <hi>Oath</hi> was to many others: For had they not had Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, how little Men regarded an <hi>Oath?</hi> and how they had <hi>Sworn</hi> one way, and then <hi>another?</hi> and how the <hi>Juſtices</hi> and <hi>Court</hi> had <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſworn</hi> themſelves now? And I told him, I was a Man of a tender Conſcience; and if they had any ſenſe of a <hi>tender Conſcience,</hi> they would conſider, that it was in <hi>Obedience</hi> to <hi>Christ's Command,</hi> that I could not <hi>Swear,</hi> But, ſaid I, if any of you can <hi>Convince</hi> me, that after <hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> had commanded <hi>not to ſwear,</hi> they did alter that Command, and commanded <hi>Chriſtians to ſwear,</hi> then ye ſhall ſee, I will <hi>ſwear.</hi> And there being many <hi>Prieſts</hi> by, I ſaid; If ye cannot do it, let your <hi>Priests</hi> ſtand up, and do it:</q> But not one of the <hi>Prieſts</hi> made any Anſwer. <hi>O,</hi> ſaid the <hi>Judge, all the World cannot Convince you.</hi> 
               <q>No, ſaid I, how is it like, the <hi>World</hi> ſhould <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince</hi> me? for <hi>the whole World lies in Wickedneſs:</hi> but bring out your <hi>Spiritual Men</hi> (as ye call them) to <hi>Convince</hi> me.</q> Then the <hi>Sheriff</hi> ſaid, and the <hi>Judge</hi> ſaid the ſame, <hi>That the Angel ſwore in the Revelations.</hi> I replied, <q>When God bringeth in his <hi>Firſt-begotten Son</hi> into the World, he ſaith. <hi>Let all the Angels of God Worſhip him;</hi> and he ſaith, <hi>Swear not at all.</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>Nay,</hi> ſaid the <hi>Judge, I will not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute.</hi> Then I ſpake to the <hi>Jury,</hi> telling them, <q>It was for Chriſt's ſake, that I could not <hi>ſwear;</hi> and therefore I warned them, not to act contrary to <hi>that</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in their <hi>Conſciences:</hi> for before his <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-ſeat</hi> they muſt all be brought. And I told them, that as for <hi>Plots,</hi> and <hi>Perſecution</hi> for <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>Popery,</hi> I do deny them in my Heart; for I am a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and ſhall ſhew forth <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> amongſt you this day: And it is for <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Doctrine</hi> I ſtand.</q> More Words I had both with the <hi>Judge</hi> and <hi>Jury,</hi> before the <hi>Jailer</hi> took me away.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Afternoon</hi> I was brought up again, and put among the <hi>Thieves</hi> a pretty while; where I ſtood with my <hi>Hat</hi> on, till at length the <hi>Jailer</hi> took it off. Then the <hi>Jury,</hi> having found this <hi>New Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> againſt me <hi>for not taking the Oath,</hi> I was called to the <hi>Bar?</hi> And the <hi>Judge</hi> asked me, <hi>What I would ſay for my ſelf?</hi> I bid them,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:51448:236"/> 
               <hi>Read the Indictment:</hi> for I would not Anſwer to that, which I did not hear. The <hi>Clerk</hi> read it, (and as he read, the <hi>Judge</hi> ſaid, <hi>Take heed, it be not falſe again:</hi>) but he read it but in ſuch a manner, that I could hardly underſtand, what he read. But when he had done, the <hi>Judge</hi> asked me, <hi>What I ſaid to the Indictment?</hi> I told him, <q>At once hearing ſo large a Writing read, and that at ſuch a diſtance, that I could not diſtinctly hear all the parts of it; I could not well tell, what to ſay to it: but if he would let me have a <hi>Copy</hi> of it, and give me time to conſider of it, I ſhould Anſwer it.</q> This put them to a little ſtand: but after a while the <hi>Judge</hi> asked me, <hi>What time I would have?</hi> I ſaid, 'Till the next <hi>Aſſize. But,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>What Plea will ye now make? Are you Guilty, or Not Guilty?</hi> I ſaid, <q>I am <hi>Not Guilty</hi> at all of denying <hi>Swearing</hi> obſtinately and wilfully: and as for thoſe things mentioned in the <hi>Oath,</hi> as <hi>Jeſuitical Plots,</hi> and <hi>Forreign Powers,</hi> I utterly deny them in my Heart: and if I could take any <hi>Oath,</hi> I ſhould take that; but I never took any <hi>Oath</hi> in all my Life.</q> The <hi>Judge</hi> ſaid, <hi>I ſaid well: But,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>The</hi> King <hi>is ſworn, the</hi> Parliament <hi>is ſworn,</hi> I <hi>am ſworn, and the</hi> Juſtices <hi>are ſworn, and the Law is preſerved by</hi> Oaths. I told him, <q>They had had ſufficient Experience of Men's <hi>Swearing;</hi> and he had ſeen, how the <hi>Juſtices</hi> and <hi>Jury</hi> had <hi>ſworn wrong</hi> the other day: And if he had read in the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Martyrs,</hi> how many of the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs</hi> had refuſed to <hi>Swear,</hi> both within the time of the <hi>Ten Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and in Biſhop <hi>Bonner</hi>'s days, he might ſee, that to deny <hi>Swearing</hi> in Obedience to Chriſt's Command, was no new thing.</q> Then he ſaid; <hi>He wiſht, the Laws were otherwiſe.</hi> I ſaid, <q>Our <hi>Yea</hi> is <hi>Yea,</hi> and our <hi>Nay</hi> is <hi>Nay:</hi> and if we tranſgreſs our <hi>Yea,</hi> and our <hi>Nay,</hi> let us ſuffer, as they do, or ſhould do, that <hi>Swear falſely:</hi> And this, I told him, we had offered to the <hi>King;</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> ſaid, <hi>It was reaſonable.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>So, after ſome further Diſcourſe had paſſed,<note place="margin">Lancaſter-<hi>Priſon.</hi>
               </note> they committed me to <hi>Priſon</hi> again; there to lie till the next <hi>Aſſize:</hi> and Col. <hi>Kirby</hi> gave order to the <hi>Jailer, To keep me Cloſe, and ſuffer no Fleſh alive to come at me; for I was not fit,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>to be diſcourſed with by Men.</hi> Then was I put up into a <hi>ſmoky Tower,</hi> where the <hi>Smoke</hi> of the other <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners</hi> came up ſo thick, that it ſtood as <hi>Dew</hi> upon the <hi>Walls;</hi> and ſometimes the <hi>Smoke</hi> would be ſo <hi>thick,</hi> that I could hardly ſee the <hi>Candle,</hi> when it burned: and I being <hi>locked</hi> under <hi>Three Locks,</hi> the <hi>

And (the place being <hi>high,</hi> and open to the <hi>Wind</hi>) ſometimes as <hi>fast,</hi> as I <hi>ſtopt</hi> it, the <hi>Wind</hi> being high and fierce, would <hi>blow</hi> it <hi>out</hi> again.

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Aſſize</hi> began on the 16th <hi>day</hi> of the <hi>Month</hi> called <hi>March,</hi>

               </note> 1664/5. And the ſame Judges, <hi>Twiſden</hi> and <hi>Turner,</hi> coming that <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit</hi> again, Judge <hi>Twiſden</hi> ſate this time on the <hi>Crown-Bench;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:51448:237"/> him I was brought. Now I had <hi>Informed</hi> my ſelf again of the <hi>Errors,</hi> that were in this <hi>Indictment</hi> alſo: For though at the <hi>Aſſize</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Judge <hi>Turner</hi> had ſaid to the <hi>Officers</hi> in <hi>Court, Pray ſee, that all the Oath be in the Indictment, and that the word,</hi> Subject, <hi>be in; and that the</hi> Day <hi>of the</hi> Month, <hi>and</hi> Year <hi>of the</hi> King <hi>be put in right: For it is a ſhame, that ſo many</hi> Errors <hi>ſhould be ſeen, and found in the face of the Country;</hi> yet there were many <hi>Errors,</hi> and thoſe great ones, in this <hi>Indictment,</hi> as well as in the <hi>former.</hi> And ſurely, the <hi>Hand</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> was in it, to confound their <hi>miſchievous Work</hi> againſt me, and to <hi>blind</hi> them therein: Inſomuch, that although, after the <hi>Indictment</hi> was drawn at the former <hi>Aſſize,</hi> the <hi>Judge Examined</hi> it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and tried it with the <hi>Clerks;</hi> yet the Word, <hi>Subject,</hi> was left out of this <hi>Indictment</hi> alſo, and the <hi>Day</hi> of the <hi>Month</hi> was put in wrong, and ſeveral <hi>Material Words</hi> of the <hi>Oath</hi> were left out: Yet they went on confidently againſt me, thinking, all was ſafe and well. And when I was ſet to the <hi>Bar,</hi> and the <hi>Jury</hi> called over to be <hi>ſworn,</hi> the <hi>Clerk</hi> asked me, <hi>Firſt; Whether I had any Objection to make againſt any of the Jury?</hi> I told him, 'I knew none of them. Then having <hi>ſworn</hi> the <hi>Jury,</hi> they <hi>ſwore three</hi> of the <hi>Officers</hi> of the <hi>Court,</hi> to prove, <hi>That the</hi> Oath <hi>was tendred to me at the last</hi> Aſſizes, <hi>according to the Indictment. Come, come,</hi> ſaid the <hi>Judge, It was not done in a Corner.</hi> Then he asked me, <hi>What I had ſaid to it?</hi> or, <hi>Whether I had taken the</hi> Oath <hi>at the laſt Aſſize?</hi> I told him, what I had ſaid, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>That the <hi>Book</hi> they gave me to <hi>Swear</hi> on, ſaith, <hi>Swear not at all:</hi>
               </q> And I repeated more, of what I had formerly ſaid to them, as it now came to my remembrance. Whereupon the <hi>Judge</hi> ſaid; <hi>I will not diſpute with you, but in point of</hi> Law. <q>Then, ſaid I, I have ſomething to ſpeak to the <hi>Jury</hi> concerning the <hi>Indictment.</hi>
               </q> He told me, <hi>I muſt not ſpeak to the</hi> Jury: <hi>but if I had any thing to ſay, I muſt ſpeak to him.</hi> Then I asked him, <q>Whether the <hi>Oath</hi> was to be tendred to the <hi>King's Subjects only,</hi> or to the <hi>Subjects</hi> of <hi>Forreign Princes?</hi>
               </q> He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <hi>To the Subjects of this Realm: for I will ſpeak nothing to you,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>but in point of Law.</hi> 
               <q>Then, ſaid I, Look the <hi>Indictment,</hi> and thou may'ſt ſee, that the Word, <hi>Subject,</hi> is left out of this <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment</hi> alſo. And therefore, ſeeing the <hi>Oath</hi> is not to be tendred to any, but the <hi>Subjects</hi> of this <hi>Realm,</hi> and ye have not put me in as a <hi>Subject;</hi> the <hi>Court</hi> is to take no notice of this <hi>Indictment.</hi>
               </q> I had no ſooner ſpoke thus, but the <hi>Judge</hi> cried; <hi>Take him away, Jailer, take him away:</hi> So I was preſently hurried away. And the <hi>Jailer</hi> and <hi>People</hi> looked, when I ſhould be called for again; but I was never brought forth to the <hi>Court</hi> any more, though I had many other great <hi>Errors</hi> to aſſign in the <hi>Indictment.</hi> But after I was gone, the <hi>Judge</hi> asked the <hi>Jury, If they were agreed?</hi> And they ſaid, <hi>Yes;</hi> and <hi>found for the</hi> King <hi>against me:</hi> as I was told. But I was never called to hear <hi>Sentence</hi> given; nor was any <hi>Sentence</hi> given againſt me, that I could hear of. For I heard, that when they had looked more narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the <hi>Indictment,</hi> they ſaw, and were ſenſible themſelves, that the <hi>Indictment</hi> was not <hi>good:</hi> and the <hi>Judge</hi> having <hi>ſworn</hi> the <hi>Officers</hi> of the <hi>Court,</hi> that the <hi>Oath</hi> was tendred me at the <hi>Aſſize</hi> before, <hi>ſuch a day,</hi> according as was ſet in the <hi>Indictment,</hi> and that proving to be the <hi>wrong day,</hi> I ſhould have proved the <hi>Officers</hi> of the <hi>Court forſworn Men</hi> again, if the <hi>Judge</hi> would have ſuffered me to go on to <hi>plead</hi> to
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:51448:237"/> the <hi>Indictment:</hi> which was thought to be the <hi>Reaſon,</hi> why he hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried me away ſo ſoon. The <hi>Judge</hi> had paſſed <hi>Sentence</hi> of <hi>Premunire</hi> upon <hi>Margaret Fell,</hi> before I was brought before him: and it ſeems, when I was hurried away ſo, they recorded me, as a <hi>Premunired Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;</hi> though I was never brought to hear the <hi>Sentence,</hi> nor knew of it: Which was very <hi>Illegal.</hi> For they ought to have not only had me pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, to hear the <hi>Sentence</hi> given; but alſo to have asked me firſt, <hi>What I could ſay, why Sentence ſhould not be given againſt me?</hi> But they knew, I had ſo much to ſay, that they could not give <hi>Sentence,</hi> if they heard it.</p>
            <p>While I was a <hi>Priſoner</hi> in <hi>Lancaſter-Caſtle,</hi> there was a great <hi>Noiſe</hi> and <hi>Talk</hi> of the <hi>Turk's overſpreading Chriſtendom;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lancaſter-<hi>Priſon.</hi>
               </note> and great <hi>Fears</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred many. But one day, as I was walking in my <hi>Priſon-Chamber,</hi> 
               <q>I ſaw the Lord's Power turn againſt him; and that he was turning back again.</q> And I declared to ſome, what the <hi>Lord</hi> had let me ſee, when there were ſuch <hi>Fears</hi> of his <hi>over-running Chriſtendom;</hi> and within a <hi>Month</hi> after the <hi>News-Books</hi> came down, wherein it was mentioned, that <hi>They had given him a Defeat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another time, as I was walking in my <hi>Chamber,</hi> with my <hi>Eye</hi> to the <hi>Lord,</hi> 
               <q>I ſaw the <hi>Angel</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> with a <hi>glittering, drawn Sword</hi> ſtretched <hi>Southward,</hi> as though the <hi>Court</hi> had been all on a <hi>Fire.</hi>
               </q> Not long after, the <hi>Wars</hi> brake out with <hi>Holland,</hi> and the <hi>Sickneſs</hi> brake forth; and afterwards the <hi>Fire</hi> of <hi>London:</hi> So the <hi>Lord's Sword</hi> was drawn indeed.</p>
            <p>Now by reaſon of my long and cloſe <hi>Impriſonment</hi> in ſo bad a place, I was grown very <hi>weak</hi> of <hi>Body:</hi> but the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> was over all, and ſupported me through all, and enabled me to do <hi>Service</hi> for him, and for his <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> as the place would admit. For while I was in <hi>Lancaſter-Priſon,</hi> I Anſwered ſeveral <hi>Books,</hi> as the <hi>Maſs,</hi> and the <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> and the <hi>Directory,</hi> and the <hi>Church-Faith;</hi> which are the <hi>Four Chief Religions,</hi> that are got up ſince the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> days. And there being ſeveral <hi>Friends</hi> in <hi>Priſon</hi> at <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and other <hi>Priſons,</hi> for not paying <hi>Tithes,</hi> I was moved to give forth the following <hi>Lines</hi> to the World concerning <hi>Tithes:</hi>

            <p>After the <hi>Aſſize</hi> at <hi>Lancaſter</hi> was over, <hi>Col. Kirby,</hi> and ſome others of the <hi>Juſtices</hi> were very uneaſie with my being at <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> (for I had <hi>gauled</hi> them <hi>ſore</hi> at my <hi>Trials</hi> there) and they laboured much to get me removed from thence to ſome <hi>Remote Place. Col. Kirby</hi> threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that I ſhould be ſent far enough; and ſometimes he ſaid, <hi>I ſhould be ſent beyond the Seas.</hi> So about <hi>Six Weeks</hi> after the <hi>Aſſizes</hi> they got an <hi>Order</hi> from the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Council,</hi> to remove me from <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter;</hi> and with it they brought a <hi>Letter</hi> from the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Angleſey,</hi> wherein was written; <hi>That if thoſe things were found true againſt me, which I was charged withal, I deſerved no Clemency nor Mercy:</hi> And yet the <hi>greatest Matter</hi> they had againſt me was, becauſe I could not diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the Command of Chriſt, and <hi>Swear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When they had prepared for my <hi>Removal,</hi> the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder-Sheriff,</hi> and the <hi>Head-Sheriff</hi>'s <hi>Man,</hi> with ſome <hi>Bayliffs</hi> came, and fetched me out of the <hi>Caſtle;</hi> when I was ſo <hi>weak</hi> with lying in that <hi>cold, wet,</hi> and <hi>ſmoky Priſon,</hi> that I could hardly <hi>go</hi> or <hi>ſtand.</hi> They had me down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Jailer</hi>'s <hi>Houſe,</hi> where was <hi>William Kirby,</hi> a <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and ſeveral others; and they called for <hi>Wine</hi> to give me. I told them, 'I would
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:51448:238"/> have none of their <hi>Wine.</hi> Then they cried; <hi>Bring out the Horſes.</hi> 
               <q>I deſired them firſt to ſhew me their <hi>Order,</hi> or a <hi>Copy</hi> of it, if they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to <hi>Remove</hi> me:</q> But they would ſhew me none, but their <hi>Swords.</hi> Then I told them; 'There was no <hi>Sentence</hi> paſſed upon me, nor was I <hi>Premunired,</hi> that I knew of; and therefore I was not made the <hi>King's Priſoner,</hi> but was the <hi>Sheriff</hi>'s: For they and all the Country knew, that I was not fully heard at the laſt <hi>Aſſize,</hi> nor ſuffered to ſhew forth the <hi>Errors,</hi> that were in the <hi>Indictment;</hi> which were ſufficient to quaſh it, though they had kept me from one <hi>Aſſize</hi> to another, to the end they might <hi>Try</hi> me. But they all knew, there was no <hi>Sentence</hi> of <hi>Premunire</hi> paſſed upon me: And therefore I not being the <hi>King's Priſoner,</hi> but the <hi>Sheriff</hi>'s, did deſire to ſee their <hi>Order.</hi> Inſtead of ſhewing me their <hi>Order,</hi> they haled me out, and lifted me up upon one of the <hi>Sheriff</hi>'s <hi>Horſes.</hi> And when I was on <hi>Horſeback</hi> in the Street, the <hi>Town's People</hi> being gathered to gaze upon me, I told the Officers; I had received neither <hi>Chriſtianity, Civility,</hi> nor <hi>Humanity</hi> from them. So they hurried me away about <hi>Fourteen Miles</hi> to <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham;</hi> and I was ſo very <hi>weak,</hi> that I was hardly able to <hi>ſit</hi> on <hi>Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back:</hi> and my <hi>Cloaths</hi> ſmelt ſo of <hi>Smoke,</hi> that they were <hi>loathſom</hi> to my ſelf. And the <hi>Wicked Jailer,</hi> one <hi>Hunter,</hi> a young Fellow, would come behind, and give the <hi>Horſe</hi> a Laſh with his <hi>Whip,</hi> and make him <hi>skip</hi> and <hi>leap;</hi> that I, being <hi>weak,</hi> had much a-do to <hi>ſit</hi> him: and then he would come and look me in the Face, and ſay; <hi>How do you, Mr.</hi> Fox? I told him, <q>It was not <hi>Civil</hi> in him to do ſo: but the <hi>Lord cut him off ſoon after.</hi>

The <hi>next day</hi> we came to a <hi>Market Town,</hi> where ſeveral <hi>Friends</hi> came to ſee me; and <hi>Robert Widders,</hi> and divers <hi>Friends,</hi> came to me up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Road.</hi> The <hi>next Night</hi> I asked the <hi>Souldiers,</hi> 
               <q>Whither they intended to carry me, and whither I was to be ſent?</q> Some of them ſaid, <hi>Beyond Sea;</hi> others ſaid, <hi>To Tinmouth-Caſtle.</hi> And a great <hi>Fear</hi> there was amongſt them, leſt ſome ſhould <hi>Reſcue</hi> me out of their hands: but that <hi>Fear</hi> was needleſs. Next Night we came to <hi>York,</hi> where the <hi>Marſhal</hi> put me up into a great <hi>Chamber,</hi>
               <note place="margin">York</note> where there came moſt part of <hi>Two Troops</hi> to ſee me.

At night the <hi>Lord Frecheville</hi> (ſo called) who commanded thoſe <hi>Horſe,</hi> came to me, and was very Civil and Loving; and I gave him an Account

               <note place="margin">1665.

When we were come to <hi>Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Scarbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough.</note> they had me to an <hi>Inn,</hi> and gave notice to the <hi>Governour;</hi> and he ſent <hi>half a dozen Souldiers</hi> to be my <hi>Guard</hi> that <hi>Night.

               <note place="margin">Scarbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough-<hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle.</hi>
               </note> and there put me into a Room, and ſet a <hi>Centry</hi> on me: and I being ſo very <hi>weak,</hi> and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to <hi>fainting,</hi> they for a while let me go out ſometimes into the <hi>Air</hi> with the <hi>Centry.</hi> They ſoon removed me out of this <hi>Room,</hi> and put me into an <hi>Open Room,</hi> where the <hi>Rain</hi> came in: and the Room <hi>ſmoked</hi> exceedingly; which was very offenſive to me. One day the <hi>Governour,</hi> who was called Sir <hi>Jo.

Now I had got a little <hi>Fire</hi> made in it, and the <hi>Room</hi> was ſo filled with <hi>Smoke,</hi> that when they were in, they could hardly find their way out again: And he being a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> I told him, That was his <hi>Purgatory,</hi> which they had put me into. I was forced to lay out a matter of <hi>Fifty Shillings,</hi> to ſtop out the <hi>Rain,</hi> and keep the Room from <hi>ſmoking</hi> ſo much. But when I had been at that Charge, and made the <hi>Room</hi> ſomewhat <hi>tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable;</hi> they removed me out of it, and put me into a worſe <hi>Room,</hi> where I had neither <hi>Chimney,</hi> nor <hi>Fire-Hearth.</hi> And the <hi>Room</hi> being to the <hi>Sea-ſide,</hi> and lying much <hi>open,</hi> the <hi>Wind</hi> drove in the <hi>Rain</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible; ſo that the <hi>Water</hi> came over my <hi>Bed,</hi> and ran about the <hi>Room,</hi> that I was fain to skim it up with a <hi>Platter.</hi> And when my <hi>Cloaths</hi> were wet, I had no <hi>Fire</hi> to dry them; ſo that my <hi>Body</hi> was <hi>nummed</hi> with <hi>Cold,</hi> and my <hi>Fingers ſwell'd,</hi> that one was grown as <hi>big</hi> as <hi>two:</hi> and though I was at ſome Charge on this <hi>Room</hi> alſo; yet I could not keep out the <hi>Wind</hi> and <hi>Rain.</hi> Beſides, they would ſuffer few <hi>Friends</hi> to come at me, and many times not any; no, not ſo much as to bring me a little <hi>Food;</hi> but I was forced, for the <hi>Firſt-Quarter,</hi> to hire <hi>one</hi> of the <hi>World</hi> to bring me <hi>Neceſſaries:</hi> and ſometimes the <hi>Souldiers</hi> would take it from her, and then ſhe would <hi>ſcuffle</hi> with them for it. Afterwards I hired a <hi>Souldier</hi> to fetch me <hi>Water</hi> and <hi>Bread,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to make a <hi>Fire</hi> of, when I was in a <hi>Room,</hi> where a <hi>Fire</hi> could be made. Commonly a <hi>Three-penny-Loaf</hi> ſerved me <hi>Three Weeks,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>longer:</hi> and moſt of my <hi>Drink</hi> was <hi>Water,</hi> that had <hi>Wormwood</hi> ſteeped or bruiſed in it. But one time, when the <hi>Weather</hi> was very <hi>ſharp,</hi> and I had taken great <hi>Cold,</hi> I got a little <hi>Elicampane-Beer:</hi> and I heard one of the <hi>Souldiers</hi> ſay to the <hi>other, That they would play me a pretty Trick: for they would ſend for me up to the</hi> Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-Governour, <hi>and in the mean time they would drink my Strong-Beer out;</hi> and ſo they did, When I came back, one of the <hi>Souldiers</hi> came to me in a Jeer, and asked me for ſome <hi>Strong Beer,</hi> I told him, they had play'd their pretty <hi>Trick:</hi> and ſo I took no further notice of it.

                  </note> that I was Convicted of a <hi>Premunire;</hi> for the <hi>Judge</hi> did not give <hi>Sentence</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me at the <hi>Aſſizes,</hi> in <hi>open Court.</hi> But ſeeing, I am now a <hi>Priſoner</hi> here, if I may not have my <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Enlargement,</hi> let my <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Acquaintance</hi> have their <hi>Liberty</hi> to come and viſit me; as <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Friends</hi> had among the <hi>Romans,</hi> who were not <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> but <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.</hi> For <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Friends</hi> had their <hi>Liberty,</hi> and all that would, might come to him; and he had his <hi>Liberty</hi> to <hi>preach</hi> to them in his <hi>hired Houſe:</hi> But I cannot have <hi>Liberty</hi> to go into the <hi>Town,</hi> nor for my <hi>Friends</hi> to come to me here. So you, that go under the Name of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> are <hi>worſe</hi> in this reſpect, than thoſe <hi>Heathens</hi> were.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But though they would not let <hi>Friends</hi> come to me; they would often bring <hi>others,</hi> either to <hi>Gaze</hi> upon me, or to <hi>Contend</hi> with me. One time there came a great Company of <hi>Papiſts</hi> to diſcourſe with me: and they affirmed; <hi>The</hi> Pope <hi>was Infallible, and had ſtood Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible ever ſince</hi> Peter<hi>'s time.</hi> But I ſhewed them the contrary by Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory: <q>For one of the <hi>Biſhops</hi> of <hi>Rome (Marcellinus</hi> by Name) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the <hi>Faith,</hi> and Sacrificed to <hi>Idols;</hi> and therefore he was not <hi>Infallible.</hi> And I told them; If they were in the <hi>Infallible Spirit,</hi> they need not have <hi>Jails, Swords</hi> and <hi>Staves, Racks</hi> and <hi>Tortures, Fires</hi> and <hi>Faggots, Whips</hi> and <hi>Gallows,</hi> to hold up their <hi>Religion</hi> by, and to <hi>deſtroy</hi> Men's <hi>Lives</hi> about <hi>Religion:</hi> for if they were in the <hi>Infallible Spirit,</hi> they would <hi>preſerve</hi> Men's <hi>Lives,</hi> and uſe none but <hi>Spiritual Weapons</hi> about <hi>Religion.</hi> I told them alſo, what one, that had been of their <hi>Society,</hi> told me. It was a <hi>Woman,</hi> who lived in <hi>Kent,</hi> and had not only been a <hi>Papist</hi> her ſelf, but had brought over ſeveral to that <hi>Religion:</hi> but ſhe coming to be <hi>Convinced</hi> of <hi>God's Truth,</hi> and turned by it to <hi>Christ</hi> her <hi>Saviour,</hi> exhorted the <hi>Papiſts</hi> to the ſame. And one time having one of them, a <hi>Tailor,</hi> at work at her Houſe; while ſhe opened to him the <hi>Falſeneſs</hi> of the <hi>Popiſh Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> and endeavoured to draw him from it to the <hi>Truth,</hi> he drew his <hi>Knife</hi> at her, and got between her and the <hi>Door:</hi> But ſhe ſpake bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to him, and bid him <hi>put up his Knife:</hi> for ſhe knew his <hi>Principle.</hi> I asked the <hi>Woman,</hi> What ſhe thought he would have done with his <hi>Knife?</hi> and ſhe ſaid, <hi>He would have ſtabbed her. Stab thee!</hi> ſaid I; what would he have <hi>Stabbed</hi> thee for? thy <hi>Religion? Yes,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>It is the Principle of the</hi> Papiſts, <hi>if any turn from their</hi> Religion, <hi>to</hi> kill <hi>them, if they can.</hi> This <hi>Story</hi> I told thoſe <hi>Papiſts:</hi> and told them, I had it from one, that had been one of them; but had forſook their <hi>Principles,</hi> and had diſcovered their <hi>Practices.</hi> They did not deny this to be their <hi>Principle,</hi>
               </q> but ſaid; <hi>What! would I declare this abroad?</hi> I told them, <q>Yes, ſuch things ought to be declared abroad, that it might be known, how contrary their <hi>Religion</hi> was to true <hi>Chriſtianity:</hi> Whereupon they went away in a great <hi>Rage.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Another <hi>Papist</hi> came to diſcourſe with me, and he ſaid; <hi>All the</hi> Patriarchs <hi>were in</hi> Hell, <hi>from the Creation, till</hi> Chriſt <hi>came: and that when</hi> Chriſt <hi>ſuffered, he went into</hi> Hell, <hi>and the</hi> Devil <hi>ſaid to him; What comeſt thou hither for, to break open our Strong Holds? And</hi> Chriſt <hi>ſaid, To fetch them all out. And ſo,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>Christ was</hi> three days <hi>and</hi> three Nights <hi>in Hell, to bring them</hi> out. <q>I told him, that was <hi>falſe:</hi> for <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid to the <hi>Thief, This day thou ſhalt be with me in
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:51448:240"/> Paradiſe.</hi>
               </q> And <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elijah</hi> were tranſlated into <hi>Heaven.</hi> And <hi>Abraham</hi> was in <hi>Heaven:</hi> for the <hi>Scripture</hi> ſaith, <hi>Lazarus</hi> was in his <q>
                  <hi>Boſom:</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> were with <hi>Chriſt</hi> upon the <hi>Mount,</hi> before he ſuffered.</q> Theſe <hi>Inſtances</hi> ſtopt the <hi>Papiſt</hi>'s Mouth, and put him to a ſtand.</p>
            <p>Another time there came one called Doctor <hi>Witty,</hi> who was eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a great <hi>Doctor</hi> of <hi>Phyſick:</hi> He came with him, that was called the <hi>Lord Falconbridge,</hi> with whom came alſo the <hi>Governour</hi> of <hi>Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth-Caſtle,</hi> and ſeveral <hi>Knights.</hi> And I being called to them, this <hi>Witty</hi> undertook to diſcourſe with me, and asked me; <hi>What I was in Priſon for?</hi> I told him, <q>Becauſe I would not diſobey the Command of Chriſt, and <hi>Swear.</hi>
               </q> He ſaid; <hi>I ought to ſwear my Allegiance to the</hi> King. Now he being a great <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> I asked him; <q>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had not <hi>Sworn</hi> againſt the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Lords,</hi> and taken the <hi>Scotch-Covenant?</hi> And had he not ſince <hi>Sworn</hi> to the <hi>King?</hi> And what then was his <hi>Swearing</hi> good for? But my <hi>Allegiance,</hi> I told him, did not conſiſt in <hi>Swearing;</hi> but in <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Faithfulneſs.</hi>
               </q> So after ſome further Diſcourſe, I was had away to my <hi>Priſon</hi> again: And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, this <hi>Dr. Witty</hi> boaſted in the <hi>Town</hi> amongſt his <hi>Patients, That he had Conquered me.</hi> When I heard of his <hi>Boaſting,</hi> I told the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,</hi> 
               <q>It was a ſmall <hi>Boaſt</hi> in him, to ſay, <hi>He had conquered a</hi> Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: And I deſired to bid him come to me again, when he came to the <hi>Caſtle.</hi>
               </q> He came again a while after, with a matter of <hi>Sixteen</hi> or <hi>Seventeen great Perſons;</hi> and then he ran himſelf worſe on ground, than before. For in Diſcourſe he affirmed before them all, <hi>That</hi> Chriſt <q>had not enlightned every Man, that cometh into the World; <hi>and</hi> That the Grace of God, that brought Salvation, had not apppeared unto all Men: <hi>and</hi> That Christ had not died for all Men. <hi>I asked him, 'What ſort of</hi> Men <hi>thoſe were, which Chriſt had not</hi> enlightned? <hi>and whom his</hi> Grace <hi>had not appeared to?</hi>
               </q> and whom he had not <hi>died</hi> for? He ſaid, Chriſt <hi>did not die for Adulterers, and Idolaters, and Wicked Men.</hi> Then I asked him, <q>Whether <hi>Adulterers,</hi> and <hi>Wicked Men</hi> were not <hi>Sinners?</hi> And he ſaid, <hi>Yes.</hi> 'And did not <hi>Chriſt die</hi> for <hi>Sinners,</hi> ſaid I? Did he not come to call <hi>Sinners</hi> to <hi>Repentance? Yes,</hi> ſaid he. Then, ſaid I, Thou haſt ſtopt thy own Mouth. So I proved, That the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>God</hi> had appeared unto <hi>all Men,</hi> though ſome turned it into <hi>Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs,</hi> and walked deſpightfully againſt it; and that <hi>Chriſt</hi> had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned <hi>all Men,</hi> though ſome hated the <hi>Light.</hi>
               </q> Several of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that were preſent, confeſs'd, it was true; but he went away in a great Rage, and came no more at me.</p>
            <p>Another time the <hi>Governour</hi> brought a <hi>Prieſt:</hi> but his Mouth was ſoon ſtopt. Not long after he brought <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three Parliament-Men,</hi> and they asked me, <hi>Whether I did own Miniſters and Biſhops?</hi> I told them, <q>
                  <hi>Yes,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Christ</hi> ſent forth, ſuch as had <hi>freely received,</hi> and would <hi>freely give;</hi> and ſuch as were qualified, and were in the ſame <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> that they were in in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> days. But ſuch <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> as theirs were, that would go no further, than they had a <hi>great Benefice,</hi> I did not own; for they were not like the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> For <hi>Christ</hi> ſaith to his <hi>Miniſters, Go ye into all Nations, and preach the Goſpel:</hi> But ye <hi>Parliament-men,</hi> that keep your <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Biſhops</hi> in ſuch <hi>great, fat Benefices,</hi> ye have <hi>ſpoiled</hi> them all.
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:51448:240"/> for do ye think, they will go into all <hi>Nations</hi> to <hi>preach?</hi> or will go any further, than they have a <hi>great, fat Benefice?</hi> Judge your ſelves, whether they will or no.</q>
            </p>
            <p>There came another time the <hi>Widow</hi> of him, who was called the <hi>Old Lord Fairfax,</hi> and with her a great <hi>Company;</hi> and one of the Company was a <hi>Prieſt.</hi> I was moved to declare the <hi>Truth</hi> to them; and the <hi>Prieſt</hi> asked me. <hi>Why we ſaid</hi> Thou <hi>and</hi> Thee <hi>to People? for he counted us but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

And if they were <hi>Fools</hi> and <hi>Idiots,</hi> then why had not <hi>He,</hi> and ſuch as he, that looked upon themſelves as <hi>Wiſe Men,</hi> and that could not bear <hi>Thou</hi> and <hi>Thee</hi> to a <hi>Singular,</hi> alter'd the <hi>Grammar, Accidence</hi> and <hi>Bible,</hi> and put the <hi>Plural</hi> inſtead of the <hi>Singular?</hi> But if they were <hi>Wiſe Men,</hi> that had ſo <hi>tranſlated</hi> the <hi>Bible,</hi> and had made the <hi>Grammar</hi> and <hi>Accidence</hi> ſo; then I wiſht him to conſider, Whether they were not <hi>Fools</hi> and <hi>Idiots</hi> themſelves, that did not <hi>ſpeak,</hi> as their <hi>Grammars</hi> and <hi>Bibles</hi> taught them; but were offended with us, and called us <hi>Fools</hi> and <hi>Idiots,</hi> for ſpeaking ſo?</q> Thus the <hi>Prieſt</hi>'s Mouth was ſtopt; and many of the Company did acknowledge the <hi>Truth,</hi> and were pretty loving and tender: and ſome of them would have given me <hi>Money;</hi> but I would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it.</p>
            <p>After this came one called <hi>Doctor Cradock,</hi> with <hi>three Prieſts</hi> more, and the <hi>Governour,</hi> and his <hi>Lady</hi> (ſo called) and another, that was called a <hi>Lady;</hi> and a great Company with them. <hi>Dr. Cradock</hi> asked me, <hi>What I was in Priſon for?</hi> I told him; <q>For obeying the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> in not <hi>Swearing.</hi> But if he, being both a <hi>Doctor</hi> and a <hi>Juſtice</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> could <hi>Convince</hi> me, that after <hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> had forbidden <hi>Swearing,</hi> they commanded <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to <hi>Swear,</hi> then I would <hi>Swear.</hi> Here was the <hi>Bible,</hi> I told him, He might, if he would, ſhew me any ſuch <hi>Command.</hi>
               </q> He ſaid, <hi>It is written, Ye ſhall</hi> Swear <hi>in Truth and Righteouſneſs.</hi> 
               <q>Ay, ſaid I, it was written ſo in <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s time; but that was many <hi>Ages</hi> before <hi>Christ</hi> commanded <hi>not to ſwear at all:</hi> but where is it written ſo, ſince <hi>Christ</hi> forbad all <hi>Swearing?</hi> I could bring as many <hi>Inſtances</hi> out of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> for <hi>Swearing,</hi> as thou, and it may be, more too; but of what Force are they, to prove <hi>Swearing</hi> lawful in the <hi>New-Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,</hi> ſince <hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> forbad it? Beſides, ſaid I, in that <hi>Text,</hi> where it is written, <hi>Ye ſhall Swear,</hi> What <hi>[Ye]</hi> was this? Was it <hi>Ye Gentiles,</hi> or <hi>Ye Jews?</hi>
               </q> To this he would not Anſwer. But one of the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> that were with him, Anſwered, and ſaid; <hi>It was to the</hi> Jews, <hi>that this was ſpoken:</hi> and then Dr. <hi>Cradock</hi> confeſſed, it was ſo. <q>Very well, ſaid I; but where did God ever give a Command to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to <hi>Swear?</hi>
               </q> For thou knoweſt, that we are <hi>Gentiles</hi> by <hi>Nature. Indeed,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>in the Goſpel-times every thing was to be eſtabliſhed out of the Mouths of two or three Witneſſes: but there was to be no</hi> Swearing <hi>then?</hi> 
               <q>Why then, ſaid I, doſt thou force <hi>Oaths</hi> upon <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to thy own Knowledge, in the <hi>Goſpel-times?</hi> And why, ſaid I, doſt thou <hi>Excommunicate</hi> my <hi>Friends?</hi> (for he had <hi>Excommunicated</hi>
                  <pb n="302" facs="tcp:51448:241"/> abundance, both in <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> and <hi>Lancaſhire.</hi>) He ſaid, <hi>For not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to Church.</hi> 'Why, ſaid I, ye left us above <hi>Twenty Years</hi> ago, (when we were but young <hi>Lads</hi> and <hi>Laſſes</hi>) to the <hi>Presbyterians, Independents</hi> (and <hi>Baptists,</hi>) many whereof made <hi>Spoil</hi> of our <hi>Goods,</hi> and <hi>perſecuted</hi> us, becauſe we would not follow them. Now we being but <hi>Young,</hi> knew little then of your <hi>Principles:</hi> and the <hi>Old Men,</hi> that did know them, if ye had intended to have <hi>kept</hi> them to you, and have <hi>kept</hi> your <hi>Principles</hi> alive, that we might have known them, ye ſhould either not have <hi>fled</hi> from us, as ye did; or ye ſhould have ſent us your <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> and <hi>Collects,</hi> and <hi>Homilies,</hi> and <hi>Evening-Songs,</hi> (for <hi>Paul</hi> writ <hi>Epiſtles</hi> to the Saints, though he was in <hi>Priſon:</hi>) But they and we might have turned <hi>Turks</hi> or <hi>Jews,</hi> for any <hi>Collects, Homilies</hi> or <hi>Epiſtles</hi> we had from you all this while. And now thou haſt <hi>Excommunicated</hi> us, both <hi>Young</hi> and <hi>Old,</hi> and ſo have others of you done; that is, ye have put us out of your <hi>Church,</hi> before ye have got us into it, and before ye have brought us to know your <hi>Principles.</hi> And is not this <hi>Madneſs</hi> in you, to <hi>put</hi> us <hi>out,</hi> before we were <hi>brought in?</hi> Indeed, if ye had brought us into your <hi>Church;</hi> and when we had been in, if we had done ſome <hi>bad thing,</hi> that had been ſomething like a ground for <hi>Excommunication,</hi> or putting out again.</q> But, ſaid I, What doſt thou call the <hi>Church? Why,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>That which you call the Steeple-houſe.</hi> Then I asked him, <q>Whether <hi>Christ</hi> ſhed his Blood for the <hi>Steeple-houſe?</hi> and purchaſed and ſanctified the <hi>Steeple-houſe</hi> with his <hi>Blood?</hi> And ſeeing, the <hi>Church</hi> is <hi>Chriſt's Bride</hi> and <hi>Wife,</hi> and that he is the <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> Doſt thou think, the <hi>Steeple-houſe</hi> is <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Wife</hi> and <hi>Bride,</hi> and that he is the <hi>Head</hi> of that <hi>Old Houſe,</hi> or of his <hi>People?</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>No,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>Chriſt is the Head of the</hi> People, <hi>and they are the</hi> Church. Then ſaid I, <q>But you have given that Title <hi>Church</hi> to an <hi>Old Houſe,</hi> which belongs to the <hi>People;</hi> and you have taught <hi>People</hi> to believe ſo.</q> I asked him alſo, <q>Why he perſecuted <hi>Friends</hi> for not paying <hi>Tithes?</hi> And whether God did ever give a Command to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that they ſhould pay <hi>Tithes?</hi> And whether Chriſt had not ended <hi>Tithes,</hi> when he ended the <hi>Levitical Prieſthood,</hi> that took <hi>Tithes?</hi> And whether Chriſt, when he ſent forth his Diſciples to <hi>preach,</hi> had not command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to <hi>preach freely,</hi> as he had <hi>given</hi> them <hi>freely?</hi> And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> are not bound to obſerve this <hi>Command</hi> of <hi>Chriſt?</hi>
               </q> He ſaid, <hi>He would not diſpute that:</hi> Neither did I find, he was willing to ſtay on that <hi>Subject;</hi> for he preſently turned to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other matter, and ſaid, <hi>You Marry, but I know not how.</hi> I replied, 'It maybe ſo: but why doſt thou not <hi>come</hi> and <hi>ſee?</hi> Then he <hi>threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that he would uſe his</hi> Power <hi>againſt us, as he had done.</hi> 
               <q>I bid him, Take heed: for he was an <hi>Old Man.</hi> I asked him alſo, 'Where he did read from <hi>Geneſis</hi> to the <hi>Revelations,</hi> that ever any <hi>Prieſt</hi> did <hi>Marry</hi> any? And I wiſht him to ſhew me ſome Inſtance thereof, if he would have us come to them to be <hi>Married:</hi> For, ſaid I, thou haſt <hi>Excommunicated one</hi> of my Friends <hi>two Years,</hi> after he was <hi>dead,</hi> about his <hi>Marriage.</hi> And why doſt thou not <hi>Excommunicate Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and <hi>Boaz,</hi> and <hi>Ruth?</hi> Why doſt thou not uſe thy <hi>Power</hi> againſt theſe? For we do not read, that they were ever <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried</hi> by the <hi>Prieſts:</hi> but they took one another in the <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> of
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:51448:241"/> the <hi>Righteous,</hi> in the <hi>Preſence</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>People:</hi> and ſo do we. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1666"/> So that we have all the <hi>Holy Men</hi> and <hi>Women,</hi> that the <hi>Scripture</hi> ſpeaks of in this <hi>Practice,</hi> on our ſide.</q> Much Diſcourſe we had; but when he found, he could get no <hi>Advantage</hi> on me, he went away with his <hi>Company.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With ſuch ſorts of People I was much exerciſed, while I was there: for moſt, that came to the <hi>Caſtle,</hi> would deſire to ſpeak with me; and great <hi>Diſputes</hi> and <hi>Reaſonings</hi> I had with them. But as to <hi>Friends,</hi> I was as a Man <hi>buried alive:</hi> for though many <hi>Friends</hi> came from far to ſee me, yet few were ſuffered to come at me; and when any <hi>Friend</hi> came into the <hi>Caſtle</hi> about <hi>Buſineſs,</hi> if he <hi>looked</hi> but towards me, they would <hi>Rage</hi> at him. But at laſt the <hi>Governour</hi> came under ſome <hi>Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> himſelf: for he having ſent out a <hi>Privateer</hi> to <hi>Sea,</hi> they took ſome <hi>Ships,</hi> that were not <hi>Enemies-Ships,</hi> but their <hi>Friends;</hi> whereupon he was brought into ſome <hi>Trouble:</hi> after which he grew ſomewhat more <hi>Friendly</hi> to me. For before, I had a <hi>Marſhal</hi> ſet over me, on purpoſe, to get <hi>Money</hi> out of me; but I was not to give him a <hi>Farthing:</hi> and when they found, they could get nothing of me, then he was taken off again. And the <hi>Officers</hi> would often be <hi>threatning</hi> me, that <hi>I ſhould be</hi> hanged <hi>over the Wall.</hi> Nay, the <hi>Deputy-Governour</hi> told me one time, <hi>That the</hi> King, <hi>knowing, that I had a great</hi> Intereſt <hi>in the</hi> People, <hi>had ſent me thither; that if there ſhould be any Stirring in the Nation, they ſhould</hi> hang <hi>me over the</hi> Wall, <hi>to keep the</hi> People <hi>down.</hi> And there being a while after, a <hi>Marriage</hi> at a <hi>Papiſt's</hi> Houſe, upon which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion a great many of them were <hi>Met together;</hi> they talked much then of <hi>hanging</hi> me. But I told them, <q>If that was it they deſired, and it was permitted them, I was <hi>ready:</hi> for I never feared <hi>Death,</hi> nor <hi>Sufferings</hi> in my Life; but I was known to be an <hi>Innocent, peaceable Man,</hi> free from all <hi>Stirrings</hi> and <hi>Plottings,</hi> and one that ſought the Good of all Men.</q> But afterwards, the <hi>Governour</hi> grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>kinder,</hi> I ſpake to him, when he was to go to <hi>London</hi> to the <hi>Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament,</hi> and deſired him to ſpeak to him, that was called <hi>Eſq Marſh,</hi> and to Sir <hi>Francis Cob</hi> (ſo called) and to ſome others; and let them know, <hi>How long</hi> I had lain in <hi>Priſon,</hi> and <hi>for what:</hi> and he did ſo. And when he came down again, he told me, that <hi>Eſq Marſh</hi> ſaid, <hi>He would go an</hi> Hundred <hi>Miles bare-foot for my Liberty, he knew me ſo well:</hi> And ſeveral others, he ſaid, ſpake well of me. From which time the <hi>Governour</hi> was very <hi>Loving</hi> to me.</p>
            <p>There were amongſt the <hi>Priſoners,</hi> that were there, <hi>Two</hi> very <hi>bad Men,</hi> that would often ſit <hi>drinking</hi> with the <hi>Officers</hi> and <hi>Souldiers;</hi> and becauſe I would not ſit and <hi>drink</hi> with them too, that made them the <hi>worſe</hi> againſt me. One time, when theſe <hi>Two Priſoners</hi> were <hi>drunk, one</hi> of them (whoſe Name was <hi>William Wilkinſon,</hi> who was a <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> and had been a <hi>Captain</hi>) came to me, and challenged me to <hi>fight</hi> with him. I ſeeing, what <hi>Condition</hi> he was in, got out of his way; and <hi>next Morning,</hi> when he was grown more <hi>ſober,</hi> told him, <q>How unmanly a thing it was in him, to challenge a Man to <hi>fight,</hi> whoſe <hi>Principle,</hi> he knew, it was not to <hi>ſtrike;</hi> but if he was <hi>ſtrick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en</hi> on one <hi>Ear,</hi> to turn the other. And I told him, If he had a mind to <hi>fight,</hi> he ſhould have challenged ſome of the <hi>Souldiers,</hi> that could have anſwered him in his own way. But however, I told him, ſeeing
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:51448:242"/> he had <hi>Challenged</hi> me, I was now come to <hi>Anſwer</hi> him, with my <hi>Hands</hi> in my <hi>Pockets:</hi> and (reaching my <hi>Head</hi> towards him) Here, ſaid I, here is my <hi>Hair,</hi> here are my <hi>Cheeks,</hi> here is my <hi>Back.</hi>
               </q> With that he <hi>skipt</hi> away from me, and went into another <hi>Room:</hi> At which the <hi>Souldiers</hi> fell a <hi>laughing;</hi> and one of the Officers ſaid, <hi>You are a happy Man, that can bear ſuch things.</hi> Thus he was <hi>Conquered</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a <hi>Blow:</hi> But after a while he took the <hi>Oath,</hi> and gave <hi>Bond,</hi> and got out of <hi>Priſon;</hi> and not long after the <hi>Lord cut</hi> him <hi>off.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There were great <hi>Impriſonments</hi> in <hi>this</hi> and the <hi>former</hi> Years, while I was <hi>Priſoner</hi> at <hi>Lancaſter</hi> and <hi>Scarborough.</hi> At <hi>London</hi> many <hi>Friends</hi> were crowded into <hi>Newgate,</hi> and other <hi>Priſons,</hi> where the <hi>Sickneſs</hi> was; and many <hi>Friends died</hi> in <hi>Priſon:</hi> Many <hi>Friends</hi> alſo were <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,</hi> and ſeveral ſent on <hi>Ship-board</hi> by the <hi>King</hi>'s Order. Some <hi>Maſters</hi> of <hi>Ships</hi> would not carry them, but ſet them on Shore again; yet ſome were ſent to <hi>Barbados,</hi> and to <hi>Jamaica,</hi> and to <hi>Mevis,</hi> and the <hi>Lord bleſſed</hi> them there. There was one <hi>Maſter</hi> of a <hi>Ship</hi> was very <hi>wicked</hi> and <hi>cruel</hi> to <hi>Friends,</hi> that were put on <hi>Board</hi> his <hi>Ship:</hi> for he kept the <hi>Friends</hi> down under <hi>Decks,</hi> though the <hi>Sickneſs</hi> was amongſt them; ſo that many <hi>died</hi> of it.

            <p>After I had lain <hi>Priſoner</hi> above a <hi>Year</hi> in <hi>Scarborough-Caſtle,</hi> I ſent a <hi>Letter</hi> to the <hi>King,</hi> in which I gave him an <q>

               <q>So ſhould they run up and down, ſcattering their Money and their Goods, half undreſt, like mad People, as he was a <hi>Sign</hi> to them:</q> And ſo they did, when the <hi>Fire</hi> brake out, and the <hi>City</hi> was <hi>burning.</hi> Thus hath the <hi>Lord</hi> exerciſed his <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Servants,</hi> by his <hi>Power,</hi> and ſhewed them <hi>Signs</hi> of his <hi>Judgments,</hi> and ſent them to <hi>fore-warn</hi> the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:</hi> but inſtead of <hi>Repenting,</hi> they have <hi>beaten</hi> and <hi>cruelly entreated</hi> ſome; and ſome they have <hi>Impriſoned,</hi> both in the <hi>former Power</hi>'s days,

               <note place="margin">1666.

            <p>And indeed, I could not but take notice, how the <hi>Hand</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> turned againſt thoſe my <hi>Perſecutors,</hi> who had been the cauſe of my <hi>Impriſonment,</hi> or had been <hi>Abuſive</hi> or <hi>Cruel</hi> to me in it.

            <p>Being now ſet free from my <hi>Impriſonment</hi> in <hi>Scarborough-Caſtle,</hi> I went about <hi>three Miles</hi> to a large, <hi>General Meeting</hi> at a <hi>Friend's</hi> Houſe, that had been a <hi>Chief-Conſtable;</hi> and all was quiet and well. On the <hi>Fourth Day</hi> after I came into <hi>Scarborough again,</hi> and had a <hi>Meeting</hi> in the Town at <hi>Peter Hodgſon</hi>'s Houſe.

            </p>
            <p>From hence I went to <hi>Whitby;</hi> and having viſited <hi>Friends</hi> there,<note place="margin">Whitby.</note> I paſſed thence to <hi>Burlington,</hi> where I had another <hi>Meeting;</hi>

            <p>Next Day <hi>Two Friends</hi> being to take each other in <hi>Marriage,</hi> there was a very great <hi>Meeting,</hi> which I was at.

               </q> Then I ſhewed them the <hi>Duty</hi> of <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Wife,</hi> how they ſhould ſerve God, being Heirs of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> together.</p>
            <p>After the <hi>Meeting,</hi> I paſſed from thence to <hi>Grace Barwick,</hi>
               <note place="margin">G. Barwick</note> where I had a <hi>General Meeting,</hi> which was very large: and when that was over, I came to <hi>Richard Shipton</hi>'s, where I had another <hi>Meeting;</hi>

            <p>From this place paſſing through the Country, I viſited <hi>Friends,</hi> till I came to <hi>York,</hi>

            <p>About this time, ſome that had <hi>run out</hi> from <hi>Truth,</hi> and claſhed againſt <hi>Friends,</hi> were reached unto by the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> which came wonderfully over; and made them <hi>Condemn and Tear their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of Controverſies to pieces.</hi> Several <hi>Meetings</hi> we had with them, and the <hi>Lord's</hi> Everlaſting <hi>Power</hi> was over all, and ſet <hi>Judgment</hi> on the <hi>Head</hi> of that, that had <hi>run out.</hi> And in theſe <hi>Meetings</hi> which laſted <hi>whole Days,</hi> ſeveral, that had <hi>Run out</hi> with <hi>John Perrot</hi> and others, came in again, and <hi>Condemned</hi> that <hi>Spirit,</hi> that led them to <hi>Keep on their Hats, when Friends prayed, and when they themſelves prayed;</hi> and ſome of them ſaid, <hi>That</hi> Friends <hi>were more righteous than they: and that if</hi> Friends <hi>had not ſtood, they had been gone, and had fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Perdition.</hi> And thus the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> was wonderfully manifeſted, and came over all.</p>
            <p>Then was I moved of the <hi>Lord</hi> to recommend the ſetting up of <hi>Five Monthly Meetings</hi> of <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Women</hi> in the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> (beſides the <hi>Womens-Meetings</hi> and the <hi>Quarterly Meetings</hi>) to take care of <hi>God's Glory,</hi> and to admoniſh and exhort ſuch, as <hi>walked diſorderly,</hi> or care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly, and not according to <hi>Truth.</hi> For whereas <hi>Friends</hi> had had only

            <p>Having viſited <hi>Friends</hi> through the <hi>Country,</hi> we paſſed on into <hi>Kent;</hi> where after we had been at ſeveral <hi>Meetings,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Kent.</note> we had a <hi>General Meeting</hi> for the <hi>Men-Friends</hi> of that <hi>County:</hi> There alſo the <hi>Mens-Monthly Meetings</hi> for that <hi>County</hi> were ſettled in the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and eſtabliſhed in the <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> for all the <hi>Heirs</hi> of it to enter into their <hi>Services,</hi> and <hi>Care</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> for the Glory of God.

            <p>After this <hi>Meeting</hi> was over, I viſited <hi>Friends</hi> in their <hi>Meetings</hi> up and down in <hi>Kent:</hi> And when I had cleared my ſelf of the <hi>Lord's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi> in that <hi>County,</hi> I came up to <hi>London.</hi> Thus were the <hi>Mens-Monthly-Meetings</hi> ſettled through the <hi>Nation:</hi> For I had been in <hi>Berkſhire</hi> before, where moſt of the <hi>Ancient Friends</hi> of that <hi>County</hi> were in <hi>Priſon;</hi> and when I had informed them of the <hi>Service</hi> of theſe <hi>Monthly-Meetings,</hi> they were ſettled amongſt them alſo.

I writ alſo into <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> by faithful <hi>Friends,</hi> and into <hi>Scotland, Holland, Barbados,</hi> and other parts of <hi>America,</hi> adviſing <hi>Friends,</hi> to ſettle their <hi>Mens-Monthly-Meetings</hi> in thoſe Countries alſo.

               </note> that is faithful; ſo that we can now ſay, that the <hi>Goſpel-Order</hi> eſtabliſhed amongſt us, is not of <hi>Man,</hi> nor by <hi>Man,</hi> but of and by <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> in and through the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> And this <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> which is not of <hi>Man,</hi> nor by <hi>Man,</hi> but from <hi>Christ,</hi> the <hi>Heavenly Man,</hi> is above all the <hi>Orders</hi> of <hi>Men</hi> in the <hi>Fall,</hi> whether <hi>Jews, Gentiles,</hi> or <hi>Apoſtatized Chriſtians;</hi> and will be, when they are gone. For the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which is the Everlaſting <hi>Goſpel,</hi> was before the <hi>Devil</hi> was; and will be and remain for ever.

            <p>After I had travelled amongſt <hi>Friends</hi> through moſt parts of the <hi>Nation,</hi> and the <hi>Monthly-Meetings</hi> were ſettled; being returned to <hi>London,</hi>
               <note place="margin">London.</note> I ſtay'd ſome time there, viſiting <hi>Friends Meetings</hi> in and about the <hi>City.</hi> While I was in <hi>London,</hi> I went one day to Viſit him, that was called <hi>Eſq Marſh,</hi> who had ſhewed much <hi>Kindneſs</hi> both to <hi>me,</hi> and to <hi>Friends;</hi> and I happened to go, when he was at <hi>Dinner.</hi> He no ſooner heard my Name, but he ſent for me up, and would

               <note place="margin">1668. London.</note> but I had not freedom to do ſo. There were ſeveral <hi>Great Perſons</hi> at <hi>Dinner</hi> with him; and he ſaid to one of them, who was a great <hi>Papist: Here is a</hi> Quaker, <hi>which you have not ſeen before.</hi> The <hi>Papiſt</hi> askt me; <hi>Whether I did own the Chriſtening of Children?</hi> I told him, <q>There was no <hi>Scripture</hi> for any ſuch <hi>Practice.</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>What!</hi> ſaid he, <hi>Not for Chriſtening Children?</hi> I ſaid, <q>
                  <hi>Nay.</hi> I told him, the one <hi>Baptiſm</hi> by the one <hi>Spirit</hi> into one Body we owned; but to throw a little <hi>Water</hi> on a <hi>Child's Face,</hi> and ſay, that was <hi>Baptizing</hi> and <hi>Chriſtening</hi> it, there was no <hi>Scripture</hi> for that.</q> Then he asked me, <hi>Whether I did own the Catholick Faith?</hi> I ſaid, <hi>Yes:</hi> but added; <q>That neither the <hi>Pope,</hi> nor the <hi>Papiſts</hi> were in that <hi>Catholick Faith:</hi> for the true <hi>Faith</hi> works by Love, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifies the Heart; and if they were in that <hi>Faith</hi> that gives Victory, by which they might have Acceſs to God, they would not tell the People of a <hi>Purgatory,</hi> after they were <hi>dead.</hi> So I undertook to prove, <hi>That neither</hi> Pope, <hi>nor</hi> Papiſts, <hi>that held a</hi> Purgatory <hi>here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, were in the true Faith:</hi> For the true, precious, Divine <hi>Faith,</hi> which Chriſt is the Author of, gives <hi>Victory</hi> over the <hi>Devil</hi> and <hi>Sin,</hi> that had ſeparated Man and Woman from God. And if they (the <hi>Papiſts</hi>) were in the true <hi>Faith,</hi> they would never uſe <hi>Racks, Priſons,</hi> and <hi>Fines</hi> to perſecute and force others to their <hi>Religion,</hi> that were not of their <hi>Faith:</hi> For this was not the <hi>Practice</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Primitive Chriſtians,</hi> who witneſſed and enjoyed the true <hi>Faith</hi> of Chriſt; but it was the <hi>Practice</hi> of the Faithleſs <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathens</hi> ſo to do. But, ſaid I to him, ſeeing thou art a <hi>great</hi> and <hi>leading Man</hi> among the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and haſt been taught and bred up under the <hi>Pope;</hi> and ſeeing thou ſay'ſt, <hi>There is no Salvation, but in your Church,</hi> I deſire to know of thee, <hi>What it is, that doth bring Salvation in your Church?</hi>
               </q> He anſwered, <hi>A Good Life.</hi> And nothing elſe, ſaid I? <hi>Yes,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>Good Works.</hi> 
               <q>And is this it, that brings <hi>Salvation</hi> in your <hi>Church,</hi> a <hi>good Life</hi> and <hi>good Works?</hi>
               </q> Is this your <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Principle,</hi> ſaid I? <hi>Yes,</hi> ſaid he. <q>Then, ſaid I, neither <hi>Thou,</hi> nor the <hi>Pope,</hi> nor any of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> know, what it is, that brings <hi>Salvation.</hi>
               </q> Then he askt me, <hi>What brought Salvation in our Church?</hi> 
               <q>I told him, That which brought <hi>Salvation</hi> to the Church in the <hi>Apoſtles Days,</hi> the ſame brought <hi>Salvation</hi> to us, and not another; Namely, <hi>The Grace</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which, the Scripture ſays, <hi>brings Salvation, and hath appeared to all men,</hi> which taught the Saints then, and teaches us now: and this <hi>Grace,</hi> which brings <hi>Salvation,</hi> teaches <hi>To deny <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs and worldly Luſts, and to live godly, righteouſly and ſoberly.</hi> So it is not the <hi>good Works,</hi> nor the <hi>good Life,</hi> that brings the <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> but the <hi>Grace.</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>What!</hi> ſaid the <hi>Papiſt, Doth this</hi> Grace, <hi>that brings Salvation, appear unto all men?</hi> Yes, ſaid I. <hi>Then,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I deny that.</hi> But I ſaid, <q>All that deny that, are <hi>Sect-makers,</hi> and are not in the Univerſal <hi>Faith, Grace</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> which the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were in. Then he ſpake to me about the <hi>Mother-Church;</hi> and I told him: The ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Sects</hi> in <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> had accuſed us, and ſaid, <hi>We forſook our Mother-Church.</hi> The <hi>Papiſts</hi> charged us with forſaking their <hi>Church,</hi> and they ſaid; <hi>Rome</hi> was the only <hi>Mother-Church.</hi> The <hi>Epiſcopalians</hi> taxed us with forſaking the old <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and they ſaid; <hi>Theirs</hi> was the <hi>Reformed Mother-Church.</hi> The <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>
                  <pb n="324" facs="tcp:51448:252"/> and <hi>Independents</hi> blamed us for leaving them, and each of them ſaid; <hi>Theirs</hi> was the <hi>right-Reformed-Church.</hi> But I ſaid, if we could own any outward <hi>City</hi> or <hi>Place</hi> to be the <hi>Mother Church,</hi> we ſhould own outward <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where the <hi>Goſpel</hi> was firſt preached by <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, and the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> where <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſuffered; where the great <hi>Converſion</hi> to <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> by <hi>Peter</hi> was; where were the <hi>Types, Figures</hi> and <hi>Shadows,</hi> which Chriſt ended; and where Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his <hi>Diſciples To wait, until they were endued with Power from high.</hi> So, if any outward <hi>place</hi> deſerved to be called the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> that was the <hi>place,</hi> where the firſt great <hi>Converſion</hi> to <hi>Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> was.

Jeruſalem — <hi>which now is in Bondage with her Children: But</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>which is above, is free, which is the</hi> Mother <hi>of us all.

Now this we do ſee, that <hi>Jeruſalem below</hi> (which was the higheſt <hi>Place</hi> of <hi>Worſhip</hi>) and all that be like her in <hi>Profeſſion</hi> without <hi>Poſſeſſion,</hi> have more <hi>Children,</hi> than the <hi>Free Woman,</hi> that hath an <hi>Husband,</hi> which is <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that is <hi>above,</hi> the <hi>Mother</hi> of us all, that be <hi>true Chriſtians:</hi> So, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> doth not ſay, <hi>Outward Jeruſalem</hi> was the <hi>Mother,</hi> though the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>great Converſion</hi> to <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> was there.

               </q> 
               <hi>Oh!</hi> ſaid Eſq <hi>Marſh</hi> to the <hi>Papiſt, You do not know this man: If he would but come to</hi> Church <hi>now and then, he would be a Brave Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After ſome other Diſcourſe together, I went aſide with this Juſtice <hi>Marſh</hi> into another Room, to ſpeak with him concerning <hi>Friends;</hi> for he was a <hi>Juſtice</hi> of <hi>Peace</hi> for <hi>Middleſex:</hi> and being a <hi>Courtier,</hi> the other <hi>Juſtices</hi> put much of the Management of matters upon him. Now when we <hi>Two</hi> were alone together, he told me, <hi>He was in a ſtreight, how to Act between us, and ſome other Diſſenters. For,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>You cannot Swear; and the</hi> Independents, Baptiſts <hi>and</hi> Fifth-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy-People <hi>ſay alſo, They cannot Swear: and therefore,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>how ſhall I know, how to diſtinguiſh betwixt you and them, ſeeing they and you all ſay, It is for Conſcience ſake, that you cannot Swear?</hi> Then ſaid I, <q>I will ſhew thee, how to <hi>diſtinguiſh:</hi> For they (or moſt of
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:51448:252"/> them) thou ſpeakeſt of, can and do <hi>Swear</hi> in ſome <hi>Caſes:</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1669"/> but we cannot <hi>Swear</hi> in any Caſe. If a Man ſhould ſteal their <hi>Cows</hi> or <hi>Horſes,</hi> and thou ſhould'ſt ask them, whether they would <hi>Swear,</hi> they were theirs? Many of them would readily do it: But if thou try our <hi>Friends,</hi> they cannot <hi>Swear</hi> for their own <hi>Goods.</hi> Therefore, when thou putteſt the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> to any of them, ask them, <hi>Whether they can Swear in any other caſe, as for their</hi> Cow <hi>or</hi> Horſe? Which, if they be really of us, they cannot do; though they can bear <hi>Witneſs</hi> to the <hi>Truth.</hi>
               </q> Hereupon I gave him a Relation of a <hi>Trial</hi> in <hi>Barkſhire,</hi> which was thus: <q>A <hi>Thief</hi> ſtole <hi>Two Beaſts</hi> from a <hi>Friend</hi> of ours: the <hi>Thief</hi> was taken and caſt into <hi>Priſon;</hi> and the <hi>Friend</hi> appeared againſt him at the <hi>Aſſizes.</hi> But ſome body having Informed the <hi>Judge,</hi> that the Man, that Proſecuted, was a <hi>Quaker,</hi> and could not <hi>Swear;</hi> the <hi>Judge,</hi> before he heard, what the <hi>Friend</hi> could ſay, ſaid, <hi>Is he a</hi> Quaker? <hi>And will he not Swear? Then tender him the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy.</hi> So he caſt the <hi>Friend</hi> into <hi>Priſon,</hi> and <hi>Premunired</hi> him, and let the <hi>Thief</hi> go at Liberty, that had ſtolen his Goods.</q> When I had related this Caſe, Juſtice <hi>Marſh</hi> ſaid, <hi>That Judge was a wicked Man.</hi> 
               <q>But, ſaid I, If we could <hi>Swear in any Caſe,</hi> we would take the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> to the <hi>King,</hi> who is to preſerve the <hi>Laws,</hi> that preſerve every man in his <hi>Eſtate.</hi> Whereas others, that can <hi>Swear</hi> in <hi>ſome caſes,</hi> to preſerve a <hi>part</hi> of their <hi>Eſtates,</hi> if they be robbed, will not take this <hi>Oath</hi> to the <hi>King,</hi> who is to preſerve them in their <hi>whole Eſtates</hi> and <hi>Bodies</hi> alſo. So that thou may'ſt eaſily <hi>diſtinguiſh,</hi> and put a difference betwixt us, and other People.</q> This Juſtice <hi>Marſh</hi> was afterwards very ſervicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to <hi>Friends</hi> in this and other Caſes; for he kept ſeveral, both <hi>Friends</hi> and others, from being <hi>premunired,</hi> in thoſe parts where he was a <hi>Juſtice.</hi> And when <hi>Friends</hi> have been brought before him in the times of <hi>Perſecution,</hi> he ſet many of them at <hi>Liberty:</hi> And when he could not avoid ſending to <hi>Priſon,</hi> he ſent ſome for a <hi>few Hours,</hi> or for a <hi>Night.</hi> At length he went to the <hi>King,</hi> and told him: <hi>He had ſent ſome of us to Priſon contrary to his Conſcience; and he could not do ſo any more.</hi> Wherefore he removed his <hi>Family</hi> from <hi>Lime-houſe,</hi> where he lived; and took <hi>Lodgings</hi> near <hi>James</hi>'s <hi>Park.</hi> He told the <hi>King,</hi> That <hi>if he would be pleaſed to give Liberty of Conſcience, that would quiet and ſettle all; for then none could have any pretence to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie.</hi> And indeed, he was a very <hi>ſerviceable man</hi> to <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Friends</hi> in his day.</p>
            <p>We had great <hi>Service</hi> at <hi>London</hi> this year, and the <hi>Lord's Truth</hi> came over all: and many that had been out from <hi>Truth,</hi> came in again this Year, <hi>Confeſſing</hi> and <hi>Condemning</hi> their former <hi>Outgoings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now after I had ſtay'd ſome time in <hi>London,</hi> I went forth into the <hi>Countries</hi> again, viſiting <hi>Friends</hi> in <hi>Surry</hi> and <hi>Suſſex,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Surry. Suſſex.</note> and in other places that way; and afterwards travelled <hi>Northward,</hi> having <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard Fell</hi> with me. We viſited <hi>Friends,</hi> till we came to <hi>Warwick,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Warwick.</note> where many <hi>Friends</hi> were in <hi>Priſon;</hi> and we had a <hi>Meeting</hi> in the Town. After that I paſſed from thence to <hi>Birmingham</hi> and to <hi>Badgely:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Birming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham. Badgely.</note> At <hi>Badgely</hi> I had a large <hi>Meeting.</hi> After which I paſſed through the Country, viſiting <hi>Friends,</hi> till I came to <hi>Nottingham,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</note> where on the <hi>firſt day</hi> we had a precious <hi>Meeting,</hi> but not without danger of being

            <p>I paſſed on from thence, viſiting <hi>Friends</hi> through the Country, till I came to <hi>Balby,</hi> and ſo to <hi>York</hi> to the <hi>Quarterly-Meeting</hi> there; and a bleſſed <hi>Meeting</hi> we had. <hi>Friends</hi> had in <hi>Yorkſhire Seven Monthly Meetings</hi> before; and they were ſo ſenſible of the <hi>Service</hi> of them, that they deſired to have <hi>Seven</hi> more added to them: For <hi>Truth</hi> was much ſpread in that Country. Accordingly in that <hi>Quarterly Meeting</hi> they were ſettled and eſtabliſhed: So that, whereas before they had but <hi>Seven,</hi> now they have <hi>Fourteen Monthly Meetings</hi> in that <hi>County.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It being the <hi>Aſſize</hi>-time at <hi>York,</hi> there I met with Juſtice <hi>Hotham,</hi> a <hi>Well-wiſher</hi> to <hi>Friends,</hi> and one that had been <hi>Tender,</hi> and very <hi>Kind</hi> to me at the <hi>first.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After I had finiſhed my <hi>Service</hi> for the <hi>Lord</hi> in <hi>York,</hi> I paſſed fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther up into the <hi>Country:</hi> And as I went, a great <hi>Burden</hi> fell upon me; but I did not preſently know the <hi>Reaſon</hi> of it. So I came to a <hi>Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> on the <hi>First-Day</hi> at one <hi>Shipton</hi>'s,<note place="margin">R.

               <note place="margin">New-Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</note>We went on to a place called <hi>New Garden,</hi> where was a great <hi>Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> And from thence we travelled on among <hi>Friends,</hi> till we came to <hi>Bandon-Bridge</hi> and the <hi>Lands-End,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bandon-Bridge. Lands-end</note> having many <hi>Meetings,</hi> as we went; in which the mighty <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> was manifeſted, through which <hi>Friends</hi> were well refreſhed: and many <hi>People</hi> were affected with the <hi>Truth.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bandon.</note> At <hi>Bandon</hi> the <hi>Mayor's Wife,</hi> being her ſelf <hi>Convinced,</hi> deſired her <hi>Husband</hi> to come to the <hi>Meeting;</hi> but he bid her <hi>for her Life, ſhe ſhould not make known, that I was at a Meeting there.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He that was then <hi>Mayor</hi> of <hi>Cork,</hi> was very envious againſt <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Friends,</hi> and had many <hi>Friends</hi> in <hi>Priſon:</hi> And knowing, that I was in the Country, he had ſent forth <hi>Four Warrants</hi> to take me; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Friends</hi> were deſirous, that I might not ride through <hi>Cork.</hi> But being at <hi>Bandon,</hi> there appeared unto me, in a <hi>Viſion,</hi> 
               <q>A very ugly-vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſag'd Man, of a black and dark Look. My Spirit ſtruck at him in the Power of God: and it ſeemed to me, that I rid over him with my Horſe, and my Horſe ſet his Foot on the ſide of his Face.</q> When I came down in the Morning, I told a <hi>Friend,</hi> that was with me, that the <hi>Command</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> was to me to ride through <hi>Cork;</hi> but bad him, Tell no Man. So we took Horſe, many <hi>Friends</hi> being with me:<note place="margin">Cork.</note> And when we came near the <hi>Town,</hi> the <hi>Friends</hi> would have ſhewed me a way on the <hi>backſide</hi> of the <hi>Town;</hi> but I told them, <hi>My way was through the Streets.</hi> Wherefore taking one of them along with me (whoſe Name was <hi>Paul Morrice</hi>) to guide me through the <hi>Town,</hi> I rode on: and as we rode through the <hi>Market-place,</hi> and by the <hi>Mayor</hi>'s <hi>Door,</hi> the <hi>Mayor</hi> ſeeing me ride by, ſaid, <hi>There goes</hi> George Fox: <hi>but</hi> he had not power to <hi>ſtop</hi> me. When we had paſſed through the <hi>Centinels,</hi> and were come over the <hi>Bridge,</hi> we went to a <hi>Friend's Houſe,</hi> and alighted: And there the <hi>Friends</hi> told me, what a <hi>Rage</hi> was in the <hi>Town,</hi> and how many <hi>Warrants</hi> were granted forth to take me. While I was ſitting there with <hi>Friends,</hi> I felt the <hi>Evil Spirit</hi> at <hi>Work</hi> in the <hi>Town,</hi> ſtirring up <hi>Miſchief</hi> againſt me; and I felt the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Lord ſtrike</hi> at that <hi>Evil Spirit.</hi> By and by ſome other <hi>Friends</hi> coming in, told me, <hi>That it was over the Town, and amongst the</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, <hi>that I was in the Town:</hi> I ſaid, <hi>Let the</hi> Devil <hi>do his worſt.</hi> So after a while, that <hi>Friends</hi> were refreſhed one in another, and we who were <hi>Travellers,</hi> had refreſhed our ſelves, I called for my <hi>Horſe:</hi> and having a <hi>Friend</hi> to <hi>Guide me,</hi> we went on our way. But great was the <hi>Rage,</hi> that the <hi>Mayor,</hi> and others of <hi>Cork</hi> were in, that they had <hi>miſſed</hi> me, and great <hi>pains</hi> they afterwards took to have <hi>taken</hi> me; having their <hi>Scouts</hi> abroad upon the <hi>Roads</hi> (as I underſtood) to obſerve, which way I went. And afterwards there was ſcarce a <hi>Publick Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> I came to, but there came <hi>Spies</hi> to watch, if I were there. And the Envious <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> and <hi>Prieſts</hi> ſent <hi>Informations</hi> one to another
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:51448:254"/> concerning me, deſcribing me by my <hi>Hair, Hat, Cloaths</hi> and <hi>Horſe;</hi> ſo that when I was come near an <hi>Hundred Miles</hi> from <hi>Cork,</hi> they had an <hi>Account</hi> concerning me, and <hi>Deſcription</hi> of me, before I came amongſt them. There was one very <hi>Envious Magiſtrate,</hi> who was both a <hi>Priest</hi> and a <hi>Juſtice;</hi> and he got a <hi>Warrant</hi> from the <hi>Judge</hi> of <hi>Aſſize</hi> to apprehend me: which <hi>Warrant</hi> was to go over all his <hi>Circuit,</hi> which reached near an <hi>Hundred Miles.</hi> Yet the <hi>Lord</hi> diſappointed all their <hi>Counſels,</hi> and defeated all their <hi>Deſigns</hi> againſt me, and by his good <hi>hand</hi> of <hi>Providence</hi> preſerved me out of all their <hi>Snares;</hi> and gave us many ſweet and bleſſed Opportunities to viſit <hi>Friends,</hi> and ſpread <hi>Truth</hi> through that Nation. For <hi>Meetings</hi> were very large, <hi>Friends</hi> coming to them far and near; and the <hi>World's People</hi> flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in. And the powerful <hi>Preſence</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> was preciouſly felt with and amongſt us; whereby <hi>many</hi> of the <hi>World</hi> were reached, and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,</hi> and gathered to the <hi>Truth,</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Flock</hi> was increaſed: And <hi>Friends</hi> were greatly refreſhed and comforted in feeling the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> Oh, the <hi>Brokenneſs,</hi> that was amongſt them in the <hi>flowings</hi> of <hi>Life!</hi> So that, in the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> many toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have broken out into <hi>Singing,</hi> even with <hi>Audible Voices,</hi> making <hi>Melody</hi> in their <hi>Hearts.</hi>

            <p>At <hi>James Hutchinſon</hi>'s in <hi>Ireland</hi> there came many <hi>Great Perſons,</hi> deſiring to diſcourſe with me about <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Reprobation.</hi> I told them, <q>Though they judged our <hi>Principle fooliſh;</hi> it was too <hi>High</hi> for them, and they could not with their <hi>Wiſdom</hi> comprehend it: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I would diſcourſe with them according to their Capacities. You ſay (ſaid I) that God hath <hi>Ordained</hi> the greateſt part of Men for <hi>Hell,</hi> and that they were <hi>Ordained</hi> ſo before the World began: For which your <hi>Proof</hi> is in <hi>Jude.</hi> And you ſay, <hi>Eſau</hi> was Reprobated, and the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and the <hi>Stock</hi> of <hi>Ham:</hi> But Chriſt ſaith to his
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:51448:255"/> Diſciples, <hi>Go, teach all Nations;</hi> and, <hi>Go into all Nations, and preach the Goſpel of Life and Salvation.</hi> Now, if they were to go to <hi>all Nations,</hi> were they not to go to <hi>Ham</hi>'s Stock, and <hi>Eſau</hi>'s Stock? Did not Chriſt <hi>die</hi> for <hi>all?</hi> then for the Stock of <hi>Ham,</hi> and of <hi>Eſau,</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> Doth not the Scripture ſay, <hi>God would have all men to be ſaved?</hi> Mark, <hi>All Men;</hi> then the Stock of <hi>Eſau,</hi> and of <hi>Ham</hi> alſo. And doth not God ſay, <hi>Egypt my People?</hi> and that he would have an <hi>Altar</hi> in <hi>Egypt?</hi> Iſa. 19. Were there not many <hi>Chriſtians</hi> formerly in <hi>Egypt?</hi> And doth not <hi>Hiſtory</hi> ſay, that the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> would formerly have been <hi>Pope?</hi> And had not God a <hi>Church</hi> in <hi>Babylon?</hi> I confeſs, <hi>The Word came to</hi> Jacob,<note place="margin">☜</note> 
                  <hi>and the Statutes to</hi> Iſrael; <hi>the like was not to other Nations.</hi> For the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God</hi> was given to <hi>Iſrael;</hi> but the <hi>Goſpel</hi> was to be preached to <hi>all Nations,</hi> and is to be preacht. The <hi>Goſpel</hi> of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>glad Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings</hi> to all Nations; <hi>He that believes, is Saved; but he that doth not believe, is Condemned already:</hi> So the <hi>Condemnation</hi> comes through <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief.</hi> And whereas <hi>Jude</hi> ſpeaks of ſome, that were <hi>of Old Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained</hi> (or written of before) <hi>to Condemnation,</hi> he doth not ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>World</hi> began: but, <hi>Written of Old,</hi> may be referr'd to <hi>Moſes</hi> his <hi>Writings,</hi> who <hi>writ</hi> of thoſe, whom <hi>Jude</hi> mentions, namely, <hi>Cain, Corah, Balaam,</hi> and the <hi>Angels,</hi> that kept not their firſt Eſtate. And ſuch <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as followed them in their way, and <hi>Apoſtatized</hi> from the <hi>firſt ſtate</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> ſuch were and are <hi>Ordained</hi> for <hi>Condemnation</hi> by the Light and Truth, which they are gone from. And though the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>God's loving</hi> Jacob, <hi>and hating</hi> Eſau; yet he tells the <hi>Believers: We all were by nature Children of Wrath, as well as others.</hi> This includes the Stock of <hi>Jacob</hi> (of which the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi> himſelf was, and all believing <hi>Jews</hi> were:) And thus both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> were all concluded under <hi>Sin,</hi> and ſo under <hi>Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> that God might have <hi>Mercy</hi> upon all, through <hi>Jeſus Christ.</hi> So the <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Choice</hi> ſtands in <hi>Christ: and he that believes, is ſaved; and he that believes not, is condemned already.</hi> And <hi>Jacob</hi> is the <hi>Second</hi> Birth, which God loved; and both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> muſt be <hi>born again,</hi> before they can enter the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> And when you are <hi>born again,</hi> ye will know <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Reprobation:</hi> for the <hi>Election</hi> ſtands in <hi>Christ,</hi> the <hi>Seed,</hi> before the World began; but the <hi>Reprobation</hi> lies in the <hi>Evil Seed</hi> ſince the World began.</q> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner, but ſomewhat more largely, I diſcourſed with thoſe <hi>Great Perſons</hi> about this matter; and they confeſt, they had never heard ſo much before.</p>
            <p>Now after I had travelled over that <hi>Nation</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and had vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited <hi>Friends</hi> in their <hi>Meetings,</hi> as well for <hi>Buſineſs</hi> as for <hi>Worſhip,</hi> and had Anſwered ſeveral <hi>Papers</hi> and <hi>Writings</hi> from <hi>Monks, Friers,</hi> and <hi>Proteſtant Prieſts</hi> (for they all were in a <hi>Rage</hi> againſt us, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſtop the <hi>Work</hi> of the <hi>Lord:</hi> and ſome <hi>Jeſuits ſware</hi> in ſome of our hearing, that we came to ſpread our <hi>Principles</hi> in that <hi>Nation;</hi> but we ſhould not do it:) I returned to <hi>Dublin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dublin.</note> in order to take Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage there for <hi>England.</hi> And when I had ſtaid the <hi>First-Day's Meeting</hi> there, (which was very large and precious) there being a <hi>Ship</hi> ready, and the Wind ſerving, we took our <hi>Leave</hi> of <hi>Friends;</hi> parting in much <hi>Tenderneſs</hi> and <hi>Brokenneſs,</hi> in the Senſe of the Heavenly <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi>
               <pb n="332" facs="tcp:51448:256"/> that was manifeſted amongſt us.<note place="margin">1669.

Many things more I could write of that <hi>Nation,</hi> and of my <hi>Travels</hi> in it, which would be large to mention particularly: but thus much I thought good to ſignifie, that the Righteous may <hi>Rejoice</hi> in the <hi>Proſperity</hi> of <hi>Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>James Lancaſter, Robert Lodge</hi> and <hi>Thomas Briggs</hi> came back with me; <hi>John Stubbs</hi> having further <hi>Service</hi> there, ſtayed behind. We were <hi>Two Nights</hi> at <hi>Sea:</hi> In one of which a mighty <hi>Storm</hi> aroſe, that put the <hi>Veſſel</hi> in great <hi>Danger;</hi> it rained and blew ſo hard. But I ſaw, the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God</hi> went over the <hi>Winds</hi> and <hi>Storms;</hi> he had them in his hand, and his Power bound them. And the ſame <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Lord God,</hi> which carried us over, brought us back again; and in his <hi>Life</hi> gave us Dominion over all the <hi>Evil Spirits,</hi> that oppoſed us there.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Liverpool.</note>We landed at <hi>Liverpool;</hi> and went to the <hi>Mayor's Houſe,</hi> it being an <hi>Inn.</hi> And after we had ſtaid about a <hi>Quarter</hi> of an <hi>Hour</hi> in the Houſe, we went to a <hi>Friend's Houſe</hi> about a <hi>Mile</hi> out of the Town, where we ſtaid a while; and then went to <hi>Richard Johnſon</hi>'s. Whence departing the <hi>next day,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lancaſhire. Cheſhire.</note> we paſſed to <hi>William Barnes</hi> his Houſe, and ſo to <hi>William Gandy</hi>'s, viſiting <hi>Friends,</hi> and having many precious <hi>Meetings</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> and <hi>Cheſhire.</hi> We bore towards <hi>Briſtol:</hi> and when we came into <hi>Glouceſterſhire,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Glouceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire. Nailſworth</note> we met with a <hi>Report</hi> at <hi>Nailsworth,</hi> which was ſpread about that Country, <hi>That</hi> George Fox <hi>was turned Presbyterian: and that they had prepared a Pulpit for him, and ſet it in a</hi> Yard; <hi>and that there would be a Thouſand People there the next day, to hear him.</hi> I thought it ſtrange, that ſuch a <hi>Report</hi> ſhould be raiſed of me; yet as we went further on, from one <hi>Friend's</hi> Houſe to another, we met with the ſame. We went by the <hi>Yard,</hi> where the <hi>Pulpit</hi> was ſet up, and ſaw it; and went on to the Place, where <hi>Friends Meeting</hi> was to be <hi>next day,</hi> and there we ſtay'd that <hi>Night. Next day,</hi> being the <hi>First-day</hi> of the <hi>Week,</hi> we had a very large <hi>Meeting,</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> and <hi>Preſence</hi> was amongſt us.</p>
            <p>Now the occaſion of this ſtrange <hi>Report,</hi> (according as I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed) was this: There was one <hi>John Fox,</hi> a <hi>Presbyterian Priest,</hi> who uſed to go about <hi>Preaching;</hi> and ſome changing his Name (as was reported) from <hi>John</hi> to <hi>George,</hi> gave out, that <hi>George Fox</hi> had changed his <hi>Religion,</hi> and was turned from a <hi>Quaker</hi> to be a <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi> and would <hi>Preach</hi> at ſuch a <hi>Place</hi> ſuch a <hi>day.</hi> This begat ſo great a <hi>Curioſity</hi> in the People, that many went thither to hear this <hi>Quaker</hi> turned <hi>Presbyterian;</hi> who would not have gone to have heard <hi>John Fox</hi> himſelf. By this means it was Reported, they had got to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether above a <hi>Thouſand People.</hi> But when they came there, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:51448:256"/> they had a <hi>Trick</hi> put upon them,<note place="margin">1669. Glouceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</note> and that that was but a Counterfeit <hi>George Fox;</hi> and underſtood withal, that the real <hi>George Fox</hi> was hard by at <hi>Friends Meeting,</hi> there came <hi>ſeveral Hundreds</hi> of them to our <hi>Meeting,</hi> and were <hi>Sober</hi> and <hi>Attentive.</hi> 
               <q>I directed them to the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in themſelves, which would <hi>Teach</hi> them, and bring them <hi>Salvation.</hi>
               </q> And when the <hi>Meeting</hi> was done, ſome of the People ſaid, <hi>They liked</hi> George Fox <hi>the Quaker's Preaching bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than</hi> George Fox <hi>the Presbyterian's.</hi> Thus, by my providential Coming into thoſe parts at that time, was this <hi>Falſe Report</hi> diſcovered; and Shame come over them, that were the <hi>Contrivers</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>It was not long after this, that this ſame <hi>John Fox</hi> was complained of in the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Commons,</hi> for <hi>having a Tumultuous Meeting, in which Treaſonable words were ſpoken:</hi> Which (according to the beſt Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I could get of it) was thus. This <hi>John Fox</hi> had formerly been <hi>Priest</hi> of <hi>Mansfield</hi> in <hi>Wiltſhire:</hi> and being put out of that place, was afterward permitted by a <hi>Common-Prayer-Prieſt</hi> to preach ſometimes in his <hi>Steeple-Houſe.</hi> At length this <hi>Presbyterian-Prieſt,</hi> preſuming too far upon the <hi>Pariſh Prieſt's</hi> former <hi>Grant,</hi> began to be more bold, than welcom; and would have preached there, whether the <hi>Pariſh-Prieſt</hi> would or no. This cauſed a great <hi>Buſtle</hi> and <hi>Conteſt</hi> in the <hi>Stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-houſe</hi> between the <hi>Two Prieſts,</hi> and their <hi>Hearers</hi> on either ſide: in which <hi>Conteſt</hi> the <hi>Common-Prayer-Book</hi> was <hi>Cut to pieces,</hi> and (as it was ſaid) ſome <hi>Treaſonable Words</hi> were then ſpoken by ſome of the <hi>Followers</hi> of this <hi>John Fox,</hi> the <hi>Presbyterian-Prieſt.</hi> This was quickly put in the <hi>News-Book:</hi> and ſome malicious <hi>Presbyterians</hi> cauſed it to be ſo <hi>worded,</hi> as if it had proceeded from <hi>George Fox</hi> the <hi>Quaker,</hi> when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as I was above <hi>Two hundred Miles</hi> from the place, when this Buſtle happened. But when I heard it, I ſoon procured <hi>Certificates</hi> from ſome of the <hi>Members</hi> of the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Commons;</hi> who knew this <hi>John Fox,</hi> and gave it under their Hands, that it was <hi>John Fox,</hi> who had formerly been <hi>Parſon</hi> of <hi>Mansfield</hi> in <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> that was complained of to the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Commons,</hi> to be the <hi>Chief Ring-leader</hi> in that <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Aſſembly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed, this <hi>John Fox</hi> was an <hi>Ill Man:</hi> for when ſome, that had been <hi>Followers</hi> and <hi>Hearers</hi> of him, came to be <hi>Convinced</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> and received the Truth in their Inward Parts, and thereupon left following him; he coming to ſome of their Houſes to talk with them about it, and they telling him, <hi>He was in the Steps of the Falſe Prophets, preaching for Hire and Filthy Lucre, and was like them, whom Chriſt cried Wo againſt, and the Apoſtles declared againſt; ſuch as ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but their own Bellies; and telling him, Chriſt ſaid, Freely ye have received, freely give; and therefore he ſhould not</hi> take Money <hi>of People for Preaching, eſpecially, now times were ſo hard.</hi> He Replied, <hi>God bleſs Preaching: for that brings in Money, let times go how they will. And fill my Belly with good Victuals; and then call me falſe Prophet, or what you will, and kick me about the Houſe, when ye have done, if ye will.</hi> This Relation I had from a Man and his Wife (who had been formerly his <hi>Hearers</hi>) whom this <hi>John Fox</hi> (with others) cauſed deeply to ſuffer. For he, and ſome other <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Prieſts,</hi> uſing to reſort to a <hi>Widow-Woman</hi>'s Houſe, who had the <hi>Impropriation,</hi> and took the <hi>Tithes</hi> of the <hi>Pariſh,</hi> ſhe told them,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:51448:257"/> 
               <hi>There was a</hi> Quaker <hi>in that Pariſh, that would not pay her</hi> Tithes; and asked Counſel of them, what ſhe ſhould do with him. They advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her <hi>To ſend Workmen, and cut down, and carry away his Corn:</hi> which (according to their Counſel) ſhe did, and thereby <hi>Impoveriſhed</hi> the <hi>Man.</hi> But to proceed. —</p>
            <p>After this <hi>Meeting</hi> in <hi>Glouceſterſhire</hi> was over, we travelled through that County,<note place="margin">Briſtol.</note> till we came to <hi>Briſtol;</hi> where I met with <hi>Margaret Fell,</hi> who was come to viſit her Daughter <hi>Yeomans</hi> there. I had ſeen from the <hi>Lord</hi> a conſiderable time before, that I ſhould take <hi>Margaret Fell</hi> to be my <hi>Wife.</hi> And when I firſt mentioned it to her, ſhe felt the <hi>Anſwer</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> from <hi>God</hi> thereunto. But though the <hi>Lord</hi> had opened this thing unto me, yet I had not received a <hi>Command</hi> from the <hi>Lord,</hi> for the accompliſhing of it then. Wherefore I let the thing reſt, and went on in the <hi>Work</hi> and <hi>Service</hi> of the Lord, as before, according as the <hi>Lord</hi> led me; travelling up and down in this <hi>Nation,</hi> and through the <hi>Nation</hi> of <hi>Ireland.</hi> But now, after I was come back from <hi>Ireland,</hi> and was come to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and found <hi>Margaret Fell</hi> there, it opened in me from the <hi>Lord,</hi> that the thing ſhould be now <hi>Accompliſhed.</hi> And after we had diſcourſed the thing together, I told her; 'If ſhe alſo was ſatisfied with the <hi>Accompliſhing</hi> of it now, ſhe ſhould firſt ſend for her <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:</hi> 'which ſhe did. And when the reſt of her <hi>Daughters</hi> were come, I asked both them and her <hi>Sons</hi> in <hi>Law,</hi> 
               <q>If they had any thing againſt it, or for it? deſiring them to ſpeak: and they all ſeverally expreſſed their <hi>Satisfaction</hi> therein. Then I asked <hi>Margaret,</hi> 'If ſhe had fulfilled and performed her <hi>Husband's Will</hi> to her <hi>Children?</hi>
               </q> She replied, <hi>The Children knew that.</hi> Whereupon I asked them, <q>Whether, if their <hi>Mother</hi> Married, they ſhould not <hi>loſe</hi> by it?</q> And I asked <hi>Margaret,</hi> 
               <q>Whether ſhe had done any thing in <hi>lieu</hi> of it, which might Anſwer it to the <hi>Children?</hi>
               </q> The <hi>Children</hi> ſaid, <hi>She had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered it to them; and deſired me to ſpeak no more of that.</hi> I told them, <q>I was plain, and would have all things done plainly: for I ſought not any outward Advantage to my ſelf.</q> So after I had Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted the <hi>Children</hi> with it, our <hi>Intention</hi> of <hi>Marriage</hi> was laid before <hi>Friends,</hi> both <hi>privately</hi> and <hi>publickly,</hi> to the full <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of <hi>Friends;</hi> many of whom gave <hi>Teſtimony</hi> thereunto, that it was of <hi>God.</hi> After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, a <hi>Meeting</hi> being appointed on purpoſe for the <hi>Accompliſhing</hi> thereof, in the <hi>Publick Meeting-Houſe</hi> at <hi>Broad-Mead</hi> in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> we took each other in <hi>Marriage;</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> Joining us together in the <hi>Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Marriage,</hi> in the <hi>Everlaſting Covenant</hi> and <hi>Immortal Seed</hi> of <hi>Life.</hi> In the Senſe whereof living and weighty <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> were born there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by <hi>Friends,</hi> in the Movings of the Heavenly <hi>Power,</hi> which uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us together.

            </p>
            <p>After we were <hi>Married,</hi> we ſtay'd about a Week in <hi>Briſtol;</hi> and then went into the Country together to <hi>Oldſtone:</hi>

            <p>On the <hi>First Day</hi> of the <hi>Week,</hi> next after the <hi>Act</hi> came in force, I went to the <hi>Meeting</hi> at <hi>Grace-Church-Street,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gracious-Street-Meeting.</note> where I expected, the <hi>Storm</hi> was moſt likely to begin. When I came there, I found the <hi>Street</hi> full of <hi>People,</hi> and a <hi>Guard</hi> ſet to keep <hi>Friends</hi> out of their <hi>Meeting-houſe.</hi> I went thereupon to the other <hi>Paſſage,</hi> that goes out of <hi>Lombard-Street,</hi> and there alſo I found a <hi>Guard;</hi> but the <hi>Court</hi> was full of <hi>People,</hi> and a <hi>Friend</hi> was ſpeaking amongſt them: But ſpake not long. And when he had done, I ſtood up, and was moved to ſay; <q>Saul, Saul, <hi>why perſecuteſt thou me? It is hard for thee to kick againſt that, that pricks thee.</hi> Then I ſhewed, that it is <hi>Saul's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> that <hi>perſecutes</hi> ſtill; and that they, who <hi>perſecute</hi> Chriſt in his Members now, where he is made manifeſt, <hi>kick</hi> againſt that which <hi>pricks</hi> them. That it was the <hi>Birth</hi> of the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> that <hi>perſecuted</hi> the <hi>Birth</hi> born of the <hi>Spirit:</hi> and that it was the Nature of <hi>Dogs</hi> to tear and devour the <hi>Sheep;</hi> but that we ſuffered as <hi>Sheep,</hi> that did not <hi>bite</hi> again: for we were a <hi>peaceable People,</hi> and did <hi>love</hi> them, that <hi>perſecuted</hi> us.</q> After I had ſpoken a while to this Effect, the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable</hi>
               <pb n="339" facs="tcp:51448:259"/> came, with an <hi>Informer</hi> and <hi>Souldiers;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1670. London. <hi>Grac. Meet.</hi>
               </note> and as they <hi>plucked</hi> me <hi>down,</hi> I ſaid; <hi>Bleſſed are the Peace-makers.</hi> The <hi>Commander</hi> of the <hi>Souldiers</hi> put me among the <hi>Souldiers,</hi> and bid them <hi>ſecure me;</hi> ſaying to me, <hi>You are the Man I looked for.</hi> They took alſo <hi>John Burneyate</hi> and another <hi>Friend;</hi> and had us away firſt to the <hi>Exchange,</hi> and afterward towards <hi>More fields.</hi> As we went along the <hi>Streets,</hi> the <hi>People</hi> were very <hi>moderate;</hi> and ſome of them <hi>laught</hi> at the <hi>Conſtable,</hi> and told him, <hi>We would not run away.</hi> The <hi>Informer</hi> went with us <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nknown;</hi> till falling into Diſcourſe with one of the <hi>Company,</hi> he ſaid; <hi>It would never be a good World, till all People came to the good Old Religion,</hi> that was <hi>Two hundred Years ago.</hi> Whereupon I asked him, <hi>Art thou a</hi> Papiſt? <hi>What! a</hi> Papiſt-<hi>Informer? for Two hundred years ago there was no other Religion, but that of the</hi> Papiſts. He ſaw, he had <hi>enſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi> himſelf; and was Vexed at it: for as he went along the <hi>Streets,</hi> I ſpake often to him; and manifeſted, what he was. When we were come to the <hi>Mayor's Houſe,</hi> and were in the <hi>Court yard,</hi> ſeveral of the People, that ſtood about, asked me; <hi>How, and for what I was taken?</hi> I deſired them to <hi>Ask</hi> the <hi>Informer;</hi> and alſo know, what his <hi>Name</hi> was: but he refuſed to tell his <hi>Name.</hi> Whereupon one of the <hi>Mayor's Officers,</hi> looking out at a Window, told him; <hi>He ſhould tell his Name, before he went away: for the</hi> Lord Mayor (he ſaid) <hi>would know, by what Authority he intruded himſelf with</hi> Souldiers <hi>into the Execution of thoſe Laws, which belonged to the</hi> Civil Magiſtrate <hi>to Execute, and not to the</hi> Military. After this he was reſtleſs, and eager to be gone; and went to the <hi>Porter</hi> to be let out. One of the <hi>Officers</hi> called to him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Have you brought People here to Inform against, and now will you go away, before my</hi> Lord Mayor <hi>comes?</hi> Some called to the <hi>Porter,</hi> not to let him out: Whereupon he <hi>forcibly pulled open the Door, and ſlipt out.</hi> No ſooner was he come out into the <hi>Street,</hi> but the <hi>People</hi> gave a <hi>Shout,</hi> that made the <hi>Street</hi> ring again; Crying out, <hi>A Papist-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former! A Papist-Informer!</hi> We deſired the <hi>Conſtable</hi> and <hi>Souldiers</hi> to go forth, and <hi>Reſcue</hi> him out of the <hi>Peoples Hands;</hi> fearing, leſt they ſhould have done him a <hi>Miſchief.</hi> They went, and brought him into the <hi>Mayor's Entry;</hi> where we ſtaid a while: But when he went out again, the <hi>People</hi> received him with ſuch another <hi>Shout.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the <hi>Souldiers</hi> were fain to go, and <hi>Reſcue</hi> him once more: and then they had him into a Houſe in an <hi>Alley;</hi> where they perſwaded him to <hi>Change</hi> his <hi>Perriwig,</hi> and ſo he got away <hi>unknown.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the <hi>Mayor</hi> came home, we were brought into the Room, where he was: and ſome of his <hi>Officers</hi> would have taken off our <hi>Hats;</hi> which he perceiving, called to them, and bid them <hi>Let us alone, and not meddle with our Hats: for</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>they are not yet brought before me in Judicature.</hi> So we ſtood by, while he <hi>Examined</hi> ſome <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian</hi>- and <hi>Baptiſt-Teachers;</hi> with whom he was ſomewhat <hi>ſharp,</hi> and <hi>Convicted</hi> them. After he had done with them, I was brought up to the <hi>Table,</hi> where he ſate; and then the <hi>Officers</hi> took off my <hi>Hat.</hi> And the <hi>Mayor</hi> ſaid mildly to me: <hi>Mr.</hi> Fox, <hi>You are an Eminent Man amongst thoſe of your Profeſſion; pray, will you be Inſtrumental, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade them from meeting in ſuch great Numbers:</hi> for (ſaid he) ſeeing Chriſt hath promiſed, that <hi>Where two or three are met in his Name, he will be in the midſt of them;</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi> are graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:51448:260"/> pleaſed to allow of <hi>Four</hi> to <hi>meet together</hi> to <hi>Worſhip God:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1670. London. At <hi>Mayor's</hi>
               </note> Why will not you be content to partake both of <hi>Chriſt's Promiſe</hi> to <hi>Two</hi> or <hi>Three,</hi> and the <hi>King's Indulgence</hi> to <hi>Four?</hi> I anſwered to this purpoſe: <q>That <hi>Chriſt's Promiſe</hi> was not to diſcourage <hi>many</hi> from <hi>Meeting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his Name;</hi> but to encourage the <hi>Few,</hi> that the <hi>feweſt</hi> might not <hi>forbear</hi> to <hi>Meet,</hi> becauſe of their <hi>Fewneſs.</hi> But if Chriſt hath promiſed to manifeſt his <hi>Preſence</hi> in the midſt of ſo ſmall an <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> where but <hi>Two</hi> or <hi>Three</hi> were gathered in his <hi>Name;</hi> how much more would his <hi>Preſence</hi> abound, where <hi>Two</hi> or <hi>Three hundred</hi> are gathered in his <hi>Name.</hi> I wiſht him to conſider, Whether this <hi>Act</hi> would not have taken hold of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> with his <hi>Twelve Apoſtles</hi> and 70 <hi>Diſciples</hi> (if it had been in their time) who uſed to <hi>Meet often together;</hi> and that with <hi>great Numbers?</hi> However I told him, this <hi>Act</hi> did not concern <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s;</hi> for it was made againſt <hi>Seditious Meetings,</hi> of <hi>ſuch as Met, under Colour and Pretence of Religion, to contrive Inſurrections, as</hi> (the <hi>Act</hi> ſays) <hi>late Experience had ſhewen;</hi> but we had been ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently <hi>Tried</hi> and <hi>Proved,</hi> and always found <hi>peaceable:</hi> And therefore he ſhould do well, to put a difference between the <hi>Innocent,</hi> and the <hi>Guilty.</hi> He ſaid, <hi>The</hi> Act <hi>was made againſt</hi> Meetings, <hi>and a Worſhip not according to the Liturgy.</hi> I told him, <hi>[According to]</hi> was not the <hi>very ſame</hi> thing: and I askt him, 'Whether the <hi>Liturgy</hi> was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Scriptures?</hi> And whether we might not <hi>read Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> and <hi>ſpeak Scriptures?</hi> He ſaid, <hi>Yes.</hi> I told him, 'This <hi>Act</hi> took hold only of ſuch, as did <hi>Meet to plot and contrive Inſurrections, as late Experience had ſhewen:</hi> but they had never <hi>Experienced</hi> that by us. Becauſe <hi>Thieves</hi> are ſometimes on the Road, muſt not <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Men</hi> travel therefore? And becauſe <hi>Plotters</hi> and <hi>Contrivers</hi> have <hi>Met</hi> to do <hi>Miſchief,</hi> muſt not an <hi>honeſt, peaceable People Meet to do Good?</hi> If we had been a People, that did <hi>Meet to Plot and Contrive In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrections,</hi> &amp;c. we might have drawn our ſelves into <hi>Fours;</hi> for <hi>Four</hi> might do more <hi>Miſchief</hi> in <hi>Plotting,</hi> than if there were <hi>Four Hundred;</hi> becauſe <hi>Four</hi> might ſpeak out their Minds more <hi>freely</hi> one to another, than <hi>Four Hundred</hi> could. Therefore we being <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,</hi> and not the <hi>People</hi> this <hi>Act</hi> concerns; we keep our <hi>Meetings,</hi> as we uſed to do: and, I ſaid, I believed, that he knew in his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, we were <hi>Innocent.</hi>
               </q> After this, and ſome more <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> he took our <hi>Names,</hi> and the <hi>places,</hi> where we <hi>lodged;</hi> and at length, inaſmuch as the <hi>Informer</hi> was gone, ſet us at <hi>Liberty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being ſet at <hi>Liberty,</hi> the <hi>Friends,</hi> that were with me, asked me,<note place="margin">Grac. Meet.</note> 
               <hi>Whether I would go?</hi> I told them, <q>To <hi>Gracious-Street-Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> again, if it were not over.</q> When we came there, the <hi>People</hi> were generally gone; only ſome few ſtood at the Gate. We went into <hi>Gerrard Roberts</hi> his Houſe; and from thence I ſent out to know, how the other <hi>Meetings</hi> in the <hi>City</hi> were? And I underſtood, that at <hi>ſome</hi> of the <hi>Meeting-places Friends</hi> were <hi>kept out;</hi> and at others they were <hi>taken,</hi> but ſet at <hi>Liberty</hi> again a few days after. A glorious time it was; for the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> came over all, and his Everlaſting <hi>Truth</hi> got <hi>Renown.</hi> For as faſt as ſome, that were <hi>ſpeaking,</hi> were <hi>taken down,</hi> others were moved of the <hi>Lord</hi> to <hi>ſtand up</hi> and <hi>ſpeak;</hi> to the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the People: and the more, becauſe many <hi>Baptiſts</hi> and other <hi>Sectaries</hi> left their <hi>Publick Meetings,</hi> and came to ſee, how the <hi>Quakers</hi>
               <pb n="341" facs="tcp:51448:260"/> would <hi>ſtand?</hi> As for the <hi>Informer</hi> aforeſaid, he was ſo frighted,<note place="margin">1670. London.</note> that there durſt hardly any <hi>Informer</hi> appear <hi>publickly</hi> again in <hi>London</hi> for ſome time after. But the <hi>Mayor,</hi> whoſe Name was <hi>Samuel Starling,</hi> though he carried himſelf <hi>ſmoothly</hi> towards us, proved afterwards a very great <hi>Perſecutor</hi> of our <hi>Friends;</hi> many of whom he caſt into <hi>Priſon,</hi> as may be ſeen in the <hi>Books</hi> of the <hi>Trials</hi> of <hi>W. Penn, W. Mead,</hi> and others at the <hi>Old Baily</hi> this Year.</p>
            <p>After ſome time, the <hi>Heat</hi> of <hi>Perſecution</hi> in the <hi>City</hi> began to abate, and <hi>Meetings</hi> were quieter there: and I being then clear of the <hi>City,</hi> went to viſit <hi>Friends</hi> in the <hi>Country;</hi> having ſeveral <hi>Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> as I went, in <hi>Middleſex, Buckinghamſhire</hi> and <hi>Oxfordſhire,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Middleſez. Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamſhire. Oxfordſhire <hi>Reading.</hi>
               </note> which were quiet: though in ſome places there was much <hi>Threatning.</hi> At <hi>Reading</hi> moſt of the <hi>Friends</hi> were in <hi>Priſon;</hi> and I went thither to <hi>Viſit</hi> them: And when I had been a while with them, the <hi>Friends</hi> that were <hi>Priſoners,</hi> gathered together, and ſeveral other <hi>Perſons</hi> came in; ſo that I had a fine Opportunity amongſt them, and <q>declared the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> encouraging them in the <hi>Truth:</hi> and they were Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed in feeling the <hi>Preſence</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> amongſt them.</q> When the <hi>Meeting</hi> was ended, the <hi>Jailer</hi> underſtanding, that I was there, the <hi>Friends</hi> were troubled, and concerned how to get me out ſafe again: for they feared, leſt he ſhould ſtop me. But after I had ſtaid a while, and <hi>Eaten</hi> with them, I went down the <hi>Stairs:</hi> and the <hi>Jailer</hi> being at the <hi>Door,</hi> I put my hand in my <hi>Pocket,</hi> which he had ſuch an Eye to, hoping to get ſomething of me; that he asked me no <hi>Queſtion.</hi> So I gave him ſomething, and bad him, <hi>Be kind and civil to my Friends in Priſon, whom I came to Viſit:</hi> And he let me paſs out without Interruption. But ſoon after <hi>Iſaac Pennington</hi> coming to <hi>Viſit</hi> them, he ſtopt him; and cauſed him to be made a <hi>Priſoner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Next Morning</hi> I rid about <hi>Fourteen Miles</hi> to a <hi>Meeting,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

When we came into the <hi>Pariſh,</hi> ſome <hi>ſober People</hi> came to us, and told us, <hi>That the Prieſt of the Town was an Envious Man, and did Threaten us.</hi> We went on to the <hi>Meeting,</hi> which was large: and after ſome time <hi>Thomas Brigges</hi> ſtood up and ſpake. Now it ſeems, the <hi>Prieſt</hi> had got a <hi>Warrant,</hi> and ſent the <hi>Conſtables</hi> and other <hi>Officers</hi> with it: And they came to the <hi>Houſe,</hi> and ſtay'd a while, and then went away again; but did not come into the <hi>Meeting:</hi> So we in the <hi>Meeting</hi> did not know of their being there. But after <hi>Thomas Brigges</hi> had done ſpeaking. I was moved of the <hi>Lord</hi> to ſtand up, and declared the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> to the People; and a precious <hi>Meeting</hi> we had. When I had done ſpeaking, and the <hi>Meeting</hi> was ended and riſen, I heard a great <hi>Clutter</hi> in the <hi>Yard:</hi> and when we came forth, the <hi>Man</hi> of the <hi>Houſe</hi> told us, <hi>That the Officers had been in the Houſe before, but did not come into the Meeting; but went away without doing any thing. And that now the Prieſt in a great Rage had ſent them again, and his own Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant with them.</hi> But the <hi>Meeting</hi> being ended before they came, they could do nothing now: And thus the good <hi>Providence</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> preſerved us from the <hi>Wicked Deſign</hi> of the <hi>Envious Prieſt,</hi> and out of his <hi>Snare;</hi> but the <hi>Prieſt</hi> was in a great <hi>Rage.</hi>

               </q> And with many more Words I was moved to ſpeak to him; though I my ſelf was then ſo <hi>Weak,</hi> I was hardly able to ſtand: and within a few days after <hi>Amor</hi> died. I went to the Widow <hi>Dry</hi>'s at <hi>Enfield,</hi> and there I lay all that <hi>Winter; warring</hi> in <hi>Spirit</hi> with the <hi>Evil Spirits</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> that <hi>Warred</hi> againſt <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Friends.</hi> For there were great <hi>Perſecutions</hi> at this time: ſome <hi>Meeting-houſes</hi> were pluck'd down, and many were <hi>broken</hi> up by <hi>Souldiers;</hi> who would come, ſometimes a <hi>Troop</hi> of <hi>Horſe,</hi> or a <hi>Company</hi> of <hi>Foot,</hi> and they would <hi>break</hi> their <hi>Swords, Carbines, Muskets</hi> and <hi>Pikes</hi> with <hi>beating Friends:</hi> and many <hi>Friends</hi> they <hi>wounded,</hi> ſo that their <hi>Blood</hi> lay in the <hi>Streets.</hi> Amongſt others, that were <hi>Active</hi> in this <hi>Cruel Perſecution</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> my Old Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Col. <hi>Kirby</hi> was one; who with a <hi>Company</hi> of <hi>Foot</hi> went to break up ſeveral <hi>Meetings:</hi> and he would often Inquire for me at the <hi>Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> he brake up. But one time, as he went over the <hi>Water</hi> to <hi>Horſly-Down,</hi> there happening ſome <hi>Scuffle</hi> between ſome of his <hi>Souldiers,</hi> and ſome of the <hi>Watermen,</hi> he bid his Men, <hi>Fire at them;</hi> and they did ſo, and <hi>Killed</hi> ſome.</p>
            <p>But I was under great <hi>Sufferings</hi> at this time, beyond what I have words to declare. For I was brought into the <hi>Deep,</hi> and ſaw all the <hi>Religions</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> and <hi>People</hi> that lived in them, and the <hi>Prieſts</hi> that held them up; who were as a Company of <hi>Men-Eaters, eating up</hi> the <hi>People</hi> like <hi>Bread,</hi> and <hi>gnawing</hi> the <hi>Fleſh</hi> from off their <hi>Bones.</hi> But as for <hi>True Religion</hi> and <hi>Worſhip,</hi> and <hi>Miniſters</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> Alack! I ſaw, there was none amongſt thoſe of the <hi>World,</hi> that pretended to it. For they, that pretended to be the <hi>Church,</hi> were but a Company of <hi>Men-Eaters,</hi> Men of <hi>Cruel Viſages,</hi> and of <hi>long Teeth;</hi> who, though they had cried againſt the <hi>Men-Eaters</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> yet I ſaw, they were in the ſame <hi>Nature.</hi> And <hi>as</hi> the great profeſſing <hi>Jews</hi> did <hi>eat up God's People, like Bread,</hi> and the <hi>Falſe Prophets</hi> and <hi>Prieſts</hi> then preached <hi>Peace</hi> to People, ſo long as they <hi>put into their Mouths and fed them;</hi> but if they <hi>fed</hi> them not, they prepared <hi>War</hi> againſt them: <hi>they ate their Fleſh off their Bones, and chopped them for the Caldron; ſo</hi> theſe, that profeſs themſelves <hi>Chriſtians</hi> now, (both <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Profeſſors</hi>) and were not in the ſame <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> that <hi>Christ</hi> and the Holy <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were in, were in the ſame <hi>Nature,</hi> that the old, profeſſing <hi>Jews</hi> were in, and were <hi>Men-Eaters,</hi> as well as they.

               <hi>Friend</hi> could hardly ſpeak a few Words in a private <hi>Family,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1670. Enfield.</note> before they ſate down to eat <hi>Meat,</hi> but ſome were ready to <hi>Inform</hi> againſt them. A particular Inſtance of which I have heard, as followeth.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Droitwich Jo.

               <hi>fell off</hi> of his <hi>Horſe,</hi> and brake his <hi>Neck.</hi> So there was a <hi>Wretched End</hi> of a <hi>Wicked Informer;</hi> who hoped to have enriched himſelf by <hi>ſpoiling Friends:</hi> but the <hi>Lord</hi> prevented him, and <hi>Cut him off</hi> in his <hi>Wickedneſs,</hi> and <hi>ſpoiled</hi> him.</p>
            <p>Now, though it was a <hi>Cruel, Bloody, Perſecuting Time,</hi> yet the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> went over all, and his Everlaſting <hi>Seed</hi> prevailed; and <hi>Friends</hi> were made to <hi>ſtand firm</hi> and <hi>faithful</hi> in the <hi>Lord's Power:</hi> And ſome of the <hi>Sober People</hi> of the <hi>World</hi> would ſay, <hi>If Friends did not ſtand, the Nation would run into Debauchery.</hi>

                  <hi>London</hi>-Yea. Meet.</note> I tarried till that was over.

            <p>Now after this <hi>Meeting</hi> was over, and I had finiſhed my <hi>Services</hi> for the <hi>Lord</hi> here in <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Ship</hi> alſo, and the <hi>Friends</hi> that intended to go with me, being ready, I went down to <hi>Graves-end</hi> on the 12th <hi>day of the Sixth Month;</hi> my <hi>Wife,</hi> and ſeveral <hi>Friends,</hi> accompanying me to the <hi>Downs.</hi> We went from <hi>Wapping</hi> in a <hi>Barge</hi> to the <hi>Ship,</hi>

But being now <hi>Clear,</hi>
               <note place="margin">At <hi>Sea.</hi>
               </note> we ſet <hi>Sail</hi> in the <hi>Evening;</hi> and by <hi>next Morning</hi> overtook part of that <hi>Fleet</hi> about the height of <hi>Dover.</hi> We ſoon reach'd the reſt; and in a little time left them all behind us; for our <hi>Yatch</hi> was counted a very <hi>ſwift Sailer.</hi> But ſhe was very <hi>Leaky;</hi> ſo that the <hi>Sea-men,</hi> and ſome of the <hi>Paſſengers</hi> did for the moſt part <hi>Pump Day and Night.</hi> One day they obſerved, that in <hi>Two Hours time</hi> ſhe ſuck't in <hi>Sixteen Inches</hi> of <hi>Water</hi> in the <hi>Well.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When we had been about <hi>Three Weeks</hi> at <hi>Sea,</hi> one <hi>Afternoon</hi> we eſpied a <hi>Veſſel</hi> about four <hi>Leagues</hi> a-ſtern of us. Our <hi>Maſter</hi> ſaid, It was a <hi>Sally-man</hi> of <hi>War;</hi> and he ſeemed to give us <hi>Chaſe.</hi> Our Maſter ſaid, <hi>Come, let us go to Supper; and when it grows dark, we ſhall loſe him:</hi> But this he ſpake to pleaſe and pacifie the <hi>Paſſengers,</hi> ſome of whom began to be very apprehenſive of the <hi>Danger.</hi> But <hi>Friends</hi> were well ſatisfied in themſelves, having <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>God,</hi> and no <hi>Fear</hi> upon their <hi>Spirits.</hi> When the <hi>Sun</hi> was gone down, I ſaw the <hi>Ship</hi> out of my <hi>Cabbin;</hi> and I ſaw, ſhe made towards us. When it grew <hi>dark,</hi> we altered our <hi>Courſe</hi> to miſs her: but ſhe altered alſo, and gained upon us. At <hi>Night</hi> the <hi>Maſter</hi> and others came into my <hi>Cabbin,</hi> and asked me, <hi>What they ſhould do?</hi> I told them, 'I was no <hi>Mariner:</hi> and I asked them, 'What they thought was beſt to do? They ſaid, <hi>There were but two Ways, either to Outrun him; or Tack about, and hold the ſame Courſe we were going before.</hi> I told them, <q>If he were a <hi>Thief,</hi> they might be ſure, he would <hi>Tack about</hi> too: And as for <hi>Outrunning</hi> him, it was to no purpoſe to talk of that; for they ſaw, he Sailed faſter than we.</q> Then they asked me again, <hi>What they ſhould do? for</hi> (they ſaid) <hi>if the Mariners had taken</hi> Paul<hi>'s Counſel, they had not come to the Damage they did.</hi> I told them, <q>It was a <hi>Trial</hi> of <hi>Faith;</hi> and therefore the <hi>Lord</hi> was to be Waited on for <hi>Counſel.</hi>
               </q> So retiring in <hi>Spirit,</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> ſhewed me, <q>
                  <hi>That his Life and Power was placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us, and the Ship, that purſued us.</hi> I told this to the <hi>Maſter</hi> and the reſt; and that the beſt way was to <hi>Tack about,</hi> and ſteer our <hi>Right Courſe.</hi> I wiſhed them alſo to put out all their <hi>Candles,</hi> but that they ſteered by; and to ſpeak to all the <hi>Paſſengers</hi> to be ſtill and quiet.</q> About the 11th <hi>hour</hi> in the <hi>Night</hi> the <hi>Watch</hi> called, and ſaid; <hi>They were just upon us.</hi> That diſquieted ſome of the <hi>Paſſengers:</hi> whereupon I ſate up in my <hi>Cabbin;</hi> and looking through the <hi>Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hole,</hi> the <hi>Moon</hi> being not quite down, I ſaw them <hi>very near us.</hi> I was getting up to go out of the <hi>Cabbin:</hi> but remembring the <hi>Word</hi> of the <hi>Lord, That his Life and Power was placed between us, and them;</hi> I lay down again. The <hi>Maſter,</hi> and ſome of the <hi>Sea-men</hi> came again, and asked me; <hi>If they might not ſteer ſuch a Point?</hi> I told them, <q>They might do as they would.</q> By this time the <hi>Moon</hi> was gone quite down; and a freſh <hi>Gale</hi> aroſe, and the <hi>Lord hid us from them:</hi> and we ſailed briskly on, and ſaw them <hi>no more.</hi> The <hi>next day,</hi> being
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:51448:265"/> the <hi>Firſt-Day</hi> of the <hi>Week,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1671. <hi>At</hi> Sea.</note> we had a publick <hi>Meeting</hi> in the <hi>Ship</hi> (as we uſually had on that <hi>Day</hi> throughout the <hi>Voyage;</hi>) and the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Preſence</hi> was greatly among us. And I deſired the People <q>To mind the <hi>Mercies</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> who had delivered them: for they might have been all in the <hi>Turks Hands</hi> by that time, had not the <hi>Lord's Hand</hi> ſaved them.</q> About a Week after, the <hi>Maſter</hi> and ſome of the <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> endeavoured to perſuade the <hi>Paſſengers, That it was not a</hi> Turkiſh <hi>Pirate, that chaſed us; but a Merchant-man going to the</hi> Canaries. But when I heard of it, I asked them, <q>Why then did they ſpeak ſo to me? and why did they trouble the <hi>Paſſengers?</hi> And why did they <hi>Tack about</hi> from him, and alter their <hi>Courſe?</hi> And I told them, They ſhould take heed of <hi>ſlighting</hi> the <hi>Mercies</hi> of <hi>God.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Afterwards, while we were at <hi>Barbados,</hi> there came in a <hi>Merchant</hi> from <hi>Sally,</hi> and told the People;<note place="margin">☜</note> 
               <hi>That one of the</hi> Sally-men <hi>of</hi> War <hi>ſaw a</hi> Monſtrous Yatch <hi>at Sea, the greatest that ever he ſaw, and had her in Chaſe, and was juſt upon her; but that there was a</hi> Spirit <hi>in her, that he could not take.</hi> This did Confirm us in the Belief, that it was a <hi>Sally-Man</hi> we ſaw make after us; and that it was the <hi>Lord,</hi> that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered us out of his Hands.</p>
            <p>I was not <hi>Sea-ſick</hi> during the <hi>Voyage,</hi> as many of the <hi>Friends</hi> and other <hi>Paſſengers</hi> were: But the many <hi>Hurts</hi> and <hi>Bruiſes</hi> I had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly received, and the <hi>Griefs</hi> and <hi>Infirmities</hi> I had contracted in <hi>England</hi> by extream <hi>Cold</hi> and <hi>Hardſhips,</hi> that I had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone in many long and ſore <hi>Impriſonments,</hi> returned upon me, now that I came to <hi>Sea;</hi> ſo that I was very <hi>Ill</hi> in my <hi>Stomach,</hi> and full of <hi>Violent Pains</hi> in my <hi>Bones</hi> and <hi>Limbs.</hi> This was, after I had been at <hi>Sea</hi> about a <hi>Month:</hi> for during the ſpace of about <hi>Three Weeks,</hi> after I came <hi>firſt</hi> to <hi>Sea,</hi> I <hi>ſweat abundantly,</hi> chiefly my <hi>Head;</hi> and my <hi>Body</hi> brake out into <hi>Pimples,</hi> and my <hi>Legs</hi> and <hi>Feet ſwelled</hi> extreamly, ſo that my <hi>Stockings</hi> and <hi>Slippers</hi> could not be drawn on without Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty and great Pain. Then on a ſudden the <hi>Sweating</hi> ceaſed. So that when I came into the <hi>hot Climate,</hi> where others <hi>Sweat</hi> moſt freely, I could not <hi>Sweat</hi> at all; but my Fleſh was <hi>hot, dry</hi> and <hi>burning:</hi> And that which before brake out on my <hi>Body</hi> into <hi>Pimples,</hi> ſtruck in again, and ſtruck to my <hi>Stomach</hi> and <hi>Heart;</hi> ſo that I was very <hi>Ill</hi> and <hi>Weak</hi> beyond <hi>Expreſſion.</hi> Thus I continued during the reſt of the <hi>Voyage,</hi> which was about a <hi>Month:</hi> for we were <hi>Seven Weeks</hi> and ſome odd <hi>Days</hi> at <hi>Sea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the <hi>Third</hi> of the <hi>Eighth Month,</hi> early in the Morning,<note place="margin">BARBA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DOS.</note> we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the <hi>Iſland</hi> of <hi>Barbados;</hi> but it was between <hi>Nine</hi> and <hi>Ten</hi> at Night, e're we came to <hi>Anchor</hi> in <hi>Carliſle-Bay.</hi> We got on <hi>Shore,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Carliſle-Bay.</note> as ſoon as we could; and I with ſome others walked to a <hi>Friend</hi>'s Houſe, a <hi>Merchant,</hi> whoſe Name was <hi>Richard Forſtall,</hi>
               <note place="margin">R.

There I abode very <hi>Ill</hi> for ſeveral days; and was ſo far from <hi>Sweating,</hi> though in that <hi>hot Climate,</hi> that although they ſeveral times gave me things to make me <hi>Sweat,</hi> yet they could not bring me to <hi>Sweat:</hi> but what they gave me, did rather <hi>parch</hi> and <hi>dry up</hi> my <hi>Body;</hi> and made me probably worſe, than otherwiſe I might have been. Thus I continued for about <hi>Three Weeks,</hi> after I Landed,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:51448:266"/> having very much <hi>Pain</hi> in my <hi>Bones,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1671. Barbados.</note> 
               <hi>Joints</hi> and whole <hi>Body;</hi> ſo that I could hardly get any Reſt: yet notwithſtanding I was pretty Cheary, and my Spirit kept above it all. Neither did my <hi>Ilneſs</hi> take me off from the <hi>Service</hi> of <hi>Truth;</hi> but both while I was at <hi>Sea,</hi> and after I came to <hi>Barbados,</hi> before I was able to <hi>Travel</hi> about, I gave forth ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Papers,</hi> (having a <hi>Friend</hi> to write for me;) ſome of which I ſent by the firſt Conveyance for <hi>England,</hi> to be <hi>Printed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After I had reſted <hi>three</hi> or <hi>four Days</hi> at <hi>Richard Forſtall</hi>'s, where many <hi>Friends</hi> came to viſit me, <hi>John Rous,</hi> having borrowed a <hi>Coach</hi> of one of his Acquaintance there (called Colonel <hi>Chamberlain</hi>) came to fetch me in it to his Father <hi>Thomas Rous</hi>'s Houſe:<note place="margin">Tho.

            <p>Soon after I came into the <hi>Iſland,</hi> I was Informed of a remarkable <hi>Paſſage,</hi> wherein the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of <hi>God</hi> did eminently appear: It was thus.<note place="margin">Example.</note> There was a <hi>Young-Man</hi> of <hi>Barbados,</hi> whoſe Name was <hi>John Drakes</hi> (a Perſon of ſome Note in the World's Account, but a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Swearer,</hi> and a <hi>bad Man;</hi>) who having been in <hi>England,</hi> and at <hi>London,</hi> had a mind to <hi>Marry</hi> a <hi>Young Maid,</hi> that was a <hi>Friend</hi>'s <hi>Daughter,</hi> left by her <hi>Mother</hi> very <hi>Young,</hi> and with a Conſiderable <hi>Portion,</hi> to the Care and Government of ſeveral <hi>Friends,</hi> whereof I was one.

                     <p>I have been very <hi>Weak</hi> theſe <hi>Seven Weeks</hi> paſt, and ſo not able to Write my ſelf.

So that little <hi>Rest</hi> I have taken; and the chiefeſt things, that were comfortable to my Stomach, were a little <hi>Water</hi> and <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Ginger:</hi> But now I begin to drink a little <hi>Beer,</hi> as well as <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> and ſometimes a little <hi>Wine</hi> and <hi>Water</hi> mixed.

            <p>Now, becauſe I was not yet well able to <hi>Travel,</hi> the <hi>Friends</hi> of the <hi>Iſland</hi> concluded, to have their <hi>Men's-Meeting,</hi> and their <hi>Womens-Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> for the <hi>Service</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> at <hi>Thomas Rous</hi>'s, where I lay; by which means I was preſent amongſt them at each of their <hi>Meetings,</hi> and had very good <hi>Service</hi> for the <hi>Lord</hi> in both. For they had need of <hi>Information</hi> in many things; and divers <hi>Diſorders</hi> were crept in for want of <hi>Care</hi> and <hi>Watchfulneſs.</hi> 
               <q>Wherefore I exhorted them, (more eſpecially at the <hi>Mens-Meeting</hi>) to be watchful and careful with reſpect to <hi>Marriages,</hi> to prevent <hi>Friends Marrying</hi> in near <hi>Kindreds;</hi> and alſo to prevent over-haſty proceedings toward <hi>Second Marriages,</hi> after the Death of a former <hi>Husband</hi> or <hi>Wife:</hi> adviſing, that a decent Regard were had in ſuch Caſes, to the <hi>Memory</hi> of the Deceaſed <hi>Husband</hi> or <hi>Wife.</hi> And as to <hi>Friends Children marrying too young,</hi> as at <hi>Thirteen</hi> or <hi>Fourteen Years</hi> of Age, I ſhewed them the Unfitneſs thereof, and the Inconveniences and Hurts that attend ſuch <hi>Childiſh Marriages.</hi> And I admoniſhed them all to <hi>purge</hi> the <hi>Floor</hi> throughly, and to <hi>ſweep</hi> their <hi>Houſes</hi> very clean; that nothing might remain, that would <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file:</hi> And that all ſhould take care, that nothing be ſpoken out of their <hi>Meetings</hi> to the blemiſhing, or defaming one of another. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe concerning <hi>Regiſtring</hi> of <hi>Marriages, Births</hi> and <hi>Burials,</hi> I adviſed them to keep Exact <hi>Records</hi> of each in diſtinct Books for that only uſe: and alſo to <hi>Record</hi> in a Book for that purpoſe, the <hi>Condemnations</hi> of ſuch, as went out from <hi>Truth</hi> into <hi>Diſorderly Practices;</hi> and the <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Reſtoration</hi> of ſuch of them, as returned again. Alſo I recommended to their Care the providing of convenient <hi>Bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Places</hi> for <hi>Friends;</hi> which in ſome parts were yet wanting. Some Directions alſo I gave them concerning <hi>Wills,</hi> and the Ordering of <hi>Legacies</hi> left by <hi>Friends</hi> for <hi>publick <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes;</hi> and other things relating to the <hi>Affairs</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> Then as to their <hi>Blacks</hi> or <hi>Negro's,</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired them to endeavour to train them up in the <hi>Fear</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> as well them that were <hi>bought</hi> with their <hi>Money,</hi> as them that were <hi>born</hi> in their <hi>Families;</hi> that all might come to the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of the <hi>Lord:</hi> that ſo with <hi>Joſhua</hi> they might (every <hi>Maſter</hi> of a <hi>Family</hi>) ſay, <hi>As for me and my Houſe, we will ſerve the Lord.</hi> I deſired them alſo, that they would cauſe their <hi>Overſeers</hi> to deal <hi>mildly</hi> and <hi>gently</hi> with their <hi>Negro's,</hi> and not uſe <hi>Cruelty</hi> towards them; as the manner of ſome hath been, and is: And that after certain <hi>Years</hi> of <hi>Servitude</hi> they would make them <hi>free.</hi>
               </q> Many ſweet and precious things were opened in theſe <hi>Meetings,</hi> by the <hi>Spirit</hi> and in the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> to the edifying, confirming and building up of <hi>Friends,</hi> both in the <hi>Faith,</hi> and holy <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>After I had recovered ſo much <hi>Strength.</hi> that I was able to go abroad, and had been a little amongſt <hi>Friends,</hi> I went to viſit the <hi>Governour</hi> at his Houſe; <hi>Lewis Morice, Thomas Rouſe,</hi> and ſome other <hi>Friends</hi> being with me.

            <p>About a <hi>Week,</hi> after we landed in <hi>Jamaica, Elizabeth Hooton,</hi> who went with us from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Barbados,</hi> and from <hi>Barbados</hi> thither, being a <hi>Woman</hi> of a <hi>great Age,</hi> and who had travelled much in <hi>Truth's Service,</hi> and <hi>ſuffered</hi> much for it, <hi>departed</hi> this <hi>Life.</hi> She was well the <hi>Day</hi> before ſhe <hi>died;</hi> and <hi>departed in Peace,</hi> like a <hi>Lamb,</hi> bearing <hi>Teſtimony</hi> to <hi>Truth</hi> at her <hi>Departure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When we had been about <hi>Seven Weeks</hi> in <hi>Jamaica,</hi> and had brought <hi>Friends</hi> into pretty good <hi>Order,</hi> and ſettled ſeveral <hi>Meetings</hi> amongſt them, we left <hi>Solomon Eccles</hi> there; the reſt of us embarked for <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryland:</hi> leaving <hi>Friends,</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> proſperous in <hi>Jamaica,</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Power</hi> being over all, and his bleſſed <hi>Seed</hi> reigning.</p>

                  <hi>At</hi> Sea.</note>We went on <hi>Board</hi> on the 8th of the <hi>Firſt Month,</hi> 1671/2: and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Contrary Winds, were a full <hi>Week</hi> ſailing forwards and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, before we could get out of ſight of <hi>Jamaica.</hi> A difficult <hi>Voyage</hi> this proved, and pretty dangerous, eſpecially, in our paſſing through the <hi>Gulf</hi> of <hi>Florida;</hi> where we met with many <hi>Trials</hi> by <hi>Winds</hi> and <hi>Storms.</hi> But the great <hi>God,</hi> who is <hi>Lord</hi> of the <hi>Seas</hi> and of the <hi>Land,</hi> and who <hi>rideth upon the Wings of the Wind,</hi> did by his <hi>Power</hi> preſerve us through many and great <hi>Dangers,</hi> when by extream <hi>Streſs</hi> of <hi>Weather</hi> our <hi>Veſſel</hi> was divers times like to be <hi>Over-ſet;</hi> and much of her <hi>Tackling</hi> broken.

<pb n="363" facs="tcp:51448:271"/> did we <hi>pray</hi> unto the <hi>Lord:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1672.

            <p>We were at <hi>Sea</hi> betwixt <hi>Six</hi> and <hi>Seven Weeks</hi> in this <hi>Paſſage</hi> from <hi>Jamaica</hi> to <hi>Maryland.</hi> But ſome days, before we came to <hi>Land,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

They continued on <hi>Board</hi> us <hi>ſeveral days,</hi> not having any <hi>means</hi> to get off; and we had a very good <hi>Meeting</hi> with them in the <hi>Ship.</hi> But <hi>Proviſion</hi> grew <hi>ſhort,</hi> for they brought none in with them; and ours, by reaſon of the length of our <hi>Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,</hi> was well nigh <hi>ſpent,</hi> when they came to us: So that with their living upon it too, we had now little or none left. Whereupon <hi>George Pattiſon</hi> took a <hi>Boat,</hi> and ventured his <hi>Life</hi> to get to <hi>Shore;</hi> the <hi>Hazard</hi> whereof was ſo great, that all, but <hi>Friends,</hi> concluded, he would be <hi>Cast away.</hi> Yet it pleaſed the <hi>Lord</hi> to bring him ſafe to <hi>Land:</hi>
               <note place="margin">MARY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND.</note> and in a ſhort time after the <hi>Friends</hi> of the <hi>Place</hi> came to fetch us to Land alſo, in a ſeaſonable time, for our <hi>Proviſions</hi> were quite ſpent.</p>
            <p>We partook alſo of another great <hi>Deliverance</hi> in this <hi>Voyage,</hi> through the good <hi>Providence</hi> of the <hi>Lord;</hi> which we came to underſtand af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards. For when we were determined to come from <hi>Jamaica,</hi> we had our <hi>Choice</hi> of <hi>two Veſſels,</hi> that were both bound for the ſame <hi>Coaſt.</hi> One of theſe was a <hi>Frigot;</hi> the other was called a <hi>Yacht.</hi> The <hi>Maſter</hi> of the <hi>Frigot,</hi> we thought, asked unreaſonably for our <hi>Paſſage;</hi> which made us Agree with the <hi>Maſter</hi> of the <hi>Yacht,</hi> who offered to carry us <hi>Ten Shillings a-piece cheaper,</hi> than the other. We went on <hi>Board</hi> the <hi>Yacht,</hi> and the <hi>Frigot</hi> came out together with us, intending to be <hi>Conſorts</hi> during the <hi>Voyage;</hi> and for <hi>ſeveral Days</hi> we ſailed together: But what with <hi>Calms</hi> and <hi>Contrary Winds</hi> we were in a while ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And after that the <hi>Frigot,</hi> loſing her way, fell among the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards;</hi> by whom ſhe was <hi>taken</hi> and <hi>robbed,</hi> and the <hi>Maſter</hi> and <hi>Mate</hi> made <hi>Priſoners:</hi> Afterwards being retaken by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſhe was ſent home to her <hi>Owners</hi> in <hi>Virginia.</hi> Which when we came to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, we ſaw and admired the <hi>Providence</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> who preſerved us out of our <hi>Enemies Hands;</hi> and he that was <hi>Covetous,</hi> fell among the <hi>Covetous.</hi> Some <hi>Friends</hi> at <hi>Jamaica</hi> would have had us gone in the <hi>Frigot,</hi> that was taken; but the <hi>Lord</hi> in his Wiſdom ordered it otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>Here we found <hi>John Burneyate,</hi> intending ſhortly to Sail for <hi>Old England:</hi> but upon our Arrival he altered his purpoſe; and joined with us in the <hi>Lord's Service,</hi> which we were upon. He had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a <hi>General Meeting</hi> for all the <hi>Friends</hi> in the <hi>Province</hi> of <hi>Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that he might ſee them together, and take his <hi>Leave</hi> of them, before he departed out of the Country: And it was ſo ordered by the good <hi>Providence</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> that we landed juſt time enough, to reach that <hi>Meeting;</hi> by which means we had a very ſeaſonable <hi>Opportunity</hi>
               <pb n="364" facs="tcp:51448:272"/> of taking the <hi>Friends</hi> of the <hi>Province</hi> together.<note place="margin">1672.

After this we went to another Place,<note place="margin">Cliffs.</note> called the <hi>Cliffs,</hi> where another <hi>General Meeting</hi> was appointed: We went ſome part of the way by <hi>Land,</hi> and the reſt by <hi>Water;</hi> and a <hi>Storm</hi> ariſing, our <hi>Boat</hi> was run on ground, in danger to be beaten to pieces: and the <hi>Water</hi> came in upon us.

            </p>
            <p>After theſe <hi>Two General Meetings</hi> were over, we parted Company, dividing our ſelves into ſeveral <hi>Coaſts,</hi> for the <hi>Service</hi> of <hi>Truth. James Lancaſter</hi> and <hi>John Cartwright</hi> went by <hi>Sea</hi> for <hi>New-England; William Edmundſon,</hi> and <hi>three Friends</hi> more with him, ſailed for <hi>Virginia,</hi> where things were much out of <hi>Order: John Burneyate, Robert Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, George Pattiſon</hi> and <hi>I,</hi> with ſeveral <hi>Friends</hi> of the <hi>Province,</hi> went over by <hi>Boat</hi> to the <hi>Eaſtern Shore,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eaſtern-Shore.</note> and had a <hi>Meeting</hi> there on the <hi>First Day;</hi> where many People received the <hi>Truth</hi> with <hi>Gladneſs,</hi> and <hi>Friends</hi> were greatly refreſhed. A very large and Heavenly <hi>Meeting</hi> it was, and ſeveral <hi>Perſons</hi> of <hi>Quality</hi> in that Country were at it; <hi>two</hi> of which were <hi>Juſtices</hi> of the <hi>Peace.</hi> And it was upon me from the <hi>Lord,</hi> to ſend to the <hi>Indian-Emperor</hi> and his <hi>Kings,</hi> to come to that <hi>Meeting:</hi> The <hi>Emperor</hi> came, and was at the <hi>Meeting;</hi> but his <hi>Kings,</hi> lying further off, could not reach thither time enough: Yet they came after with their <hi>Cockarooſes.</hi> I had in the <hi>Evening</hi> (for they ſtaid all <hi>Night) two</hi> good <hi>Opportunities</hi> with them; and they heard the <hi>Word</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> willingly, and did confeſs to it. <q>What I ſpake to them, I deſired them to ſpeak to their <hi>People;</hi> and let them know, That <hi>God</hi> was ſetting up his <hi>Tabernacle</hi> of <hi>Witneſs</hi> in their <hi>Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs-Country,</hi> and was ſetting up his <hi>Standard,</hi> and glorious <hi>Enſign</hi> of <hi>Righteouſneſs.</hi>
               </q> They carried themſelves very courteouſly and lovingly, and inquired, <hi>Where the next Meeting would be, and they would come to it:</hi> Yet they ſaid, <hi>They had had a great Debate with their Council about their Coming, before they came now.</hi>

            <p>After this <hi>Meeting</hi> were over, and <hi>Friends</hi> were gone to their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Habitations, we ſtaid <hi>ſome Days</hi> upon the <hi>Iſland,</hi> and had ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Meetings</hi> in ſeveral parts thereof; and had good <hi>Service</hi> for the <hi>Lord.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Oiſter-bay</note> And when we were clear of the <hi>Iſland,</hi> we returned to <hi>Oiſter-Bay,</hi> waiting for a Wind to carry us to <hi>Road-Iſland;</hi> which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to be about <hi>two hundred Miles.</hi> As ſoon as the Wind ſerved, we ſet Sail;<note place="margin">ROAD-ISLAND.</note> and arrived in <hi>Road-Iſland</hi> on the <hi>thirtieth Day</hi> of the <hi>Third Month:</hi> where we were gladly received by <hi>Friends.</hi> We went to <hi>Nicholas Eaſton</hi>'s Houſe, who at that time was <hi>Governour</hi> of the <hi>Iſland;</hi> and there we lay, being very <hi>weary</hi> with travelling by <hi>Land</hi> and <hi>Sea.</hi> On the <hi>First-Day</hi> of the <hi>Week</hi> following we had a large <hi>Meeting;</hi> to which the <hi>Deputy-Governour</hi> and ſeveral <hi>Juſtices</hi> came, and were mightily affected with the <hi>Truth.</hi> The <hi>Week</hi> following, the <hi>Yearly Meeting</hi> for all the <hi>Friends</hi> of <hi>New-England,</hi>

               </note> precious and weighty; and the day following was the <hi>Womens-Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> which alſo was large and very ſolemn: and theſe <hi>two Meetings</hi> being for the <hi>Ordering</hi> the <hi>Affairs</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> many weighty things were opened, and communicated to them, by <hi>Way</hi> of <hi>Advice, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi> and <hi>Inſtruction</hi> in the <hi>Services</hi> relating thereunto; that all might be kept <hi>clean, ſweet</hi> and <hi>ſavoury</hi> amongſt them. In theſe <hi>two Meetings</hi> ſeveral <hi>Mens</hi> and <hi>Womens Meetings</hi> for other parts were agreed and ſettled, to take Care of the <hi>Poor,</hi> and other <hi>Affairs</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> and to ſee, that all, who <hi>profeſs Truth, walk</hi> according to the glorious <hi>Goſpel</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> Now when this great and <hi>General Meeting</hi> in <hi>Road-Iſland</hi> was ended, it was ſomewhat hard for <hi>Friends</hi> to part: For the glorious <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> which was over all, and his bleſſed <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> flowing amongſt them, had ſo <hi>knit</hi> and <hi>united</hi> them together, that they ſpent <hi>two Days</hi> in taking leave one of another, and of the <hi>Friends</hi> of the <hi>Iſland:</hi> and then being mightily filled with the <hi>Preſence</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> they went away with joyful Hearts to their ſeveral <hi>Habitations,</hi> in the ſeveral <hi>Colonies</hi> where they lived.</p>
            <p>When this <hi>General Meeting</hi> was fully over, and <hi>Friends</hi> had taken their <hi>Leaves</hi> one of another to depart home; we, who travelled amongſt them, diſperſed our ſelves into our ſeveral <hi>Services,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the <hi>Lord</hi> ordered us. <hi>John Burneyate,</hi> with <hi>John Cartwright</hi> and <hi>George Pattiſon</hi> went into the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> parts of <hi>New-England,</hi> in Company with the <hi>Friends,</hi> that came from thence, to viſit the <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Meetings</hi> there; whom <hi>John Stubbs</hi> and <hi>James Lancaſter</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to follow a while after, in the ſame <hi>Service</hi> of <hi>Truth:</hi> but they were not yet <hi>Clear</hi> of this <hi>Iſland. Robert Widders</hi> and <hi>I</hi> ſtaid ſome time longer alſo upon this <hi>Iſland;</hi> finding <hi>Service</hi> ſtill here for the <hi>Lord,</hi> through the great <hi>Openneſs</hi> of the <hi>People,</hi> and the daily <hi>Coming</hi> in of <hi>Freſh People</hi> in <hi>Sloops</hi> from other <hi>Colonies,</hi> for ſome time, after the <hi>General Meeting</hi> was over: So that we had many large and ſerviceable <hi>Meetings</hi> among them for ſeveral Days after.</p>
            <p>During the time, that we abode here, there was a <hi>Marriage</hi> cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated amongſt <hi>Friends</hi> in this <hi>Iſland;</hi> and we were at it. It was at a <hi>Friend's Houſe,</hi> who had formerly been <hi>Governour</hi> of the <hi>Iſland;</hi> and <hi>three Juſtices</hi> of the <hi>Peace,</hi> and many others of the <hi>World's People</hi> were there: and both they and <hi>Friends</hi> ſaid, They never ſaw ſuch a <hi>Solemn Aſſembly</hi> on ſuch an Occaſion, and ſo weighty a <hi>Marriage,</hi> and ſo comely an <hi>Order.</hi> Thus <hi>Truth</hi> was ſet over all: and this might ſerve for an <hi>Example</hi> to others; for there were ſome preſent from many other places.</p>
            <p>After this I had a great <hi>Travel</hi> in <hi>Spirit</hi> concerning the <hi>Ranters</hi> (for there were many of them in thoſe parts, and they had been <hi>rude</hi> at a <hi>Meeting,</hi> which I was not at.) Wherefore I appointed a <hi>Meeting</hi> amongſt them; and I believed, the <hi>Lord</hi> would give me Power over them: and he did ſo to his Praiſe and Glory; bleſſed be his <hi>Name</hi> for ever. There were at this <hi>Meeting</hi> many <hi>Friends,</hi> and divers of the <hi>World's People;</hi> ſome of whom were <hi>Juſtices</hi> of the <hi>Peace,</hi> and other <hi>Officers:</hi> and they were generally well affected with the <hi>Truth.</hi> But one of the <hi>Juſtices,</hi> who had been a <hi>Juſtice twenty Years,</hi> was

            <p>Then we had a <hi>Meeting</hi> at a place called <hi>Providence,</hi> which was very large; as conſiſting of many <hi>Sorts</hi> and <hi>Sects</hi> of <hi>People:</hi> and I had a great <hi>Travel</hi> upon my <hi>Spirit</hi> concerning the <hi>Meeting,</hi> that it might be preſerved quiet; and that <hi>Truth</hi> might be brought over the <hi>People,</hi> and might gain an Entrance, and have a Place in them: For they were generally above the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> in high Notions; and ſome of them came on purpoſe to diſpute. But the <hi>Lord,</hi> whom we <hi>waited</hi> upon, was with us, and his <hi>Power</hi> went over them all; and his bleſſed <hi>Seed</hi> was exalted, and ſet above all: and the <hi>Diſputers</hi> were <hi>ſilent,</hi> and the <hi>Meeting</hi> was <hi>quiet,</hi> and ended well; praiſed be the Lord! And the <hi>People</hi> went away mightily <hi>ſatisfied;</hi> much deſiring another <hi>Meeting.</hi> This place (called <hi>Providence</hi>) was about <hi>Thirty Miles</hi> from <hi>Road-Iſland;</hi> and we went to it by <hi>Water.</hi> The <hi>Governour</hi> of <hi>Road-Iſland,</hi> and many others, went with me thither; and we had the <hi>Meeting</hi> in a great <hi>Barn,</hi> which was <hi>throng'd</hi> with <hi>People,</hi> ſo that I was exceeding <hi>hot,</hi> and in a great <hi>Sweat:</hi> but all was well; the glorious <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> ſhined over all, <hi>Glory</hi> to the great <hi>God</hi> for ever!</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Narragan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet.</note>After this we went to another place called <hi>Narraganſet,</hi> about <hi>Twenty Miles</hi> from <hi>Road-Iſland;</hi> and the <hi>Governour</hi> went with us. There we had a <hi>Meeting</hi> at a <hi>Juſtice</hi>'s <hi>Houſe,</hi> where <hi>Friends</hi> had never had any <hi>Meeting</hi> before: And the <hi>Meeting</hi> was very large, for the <hi>Country</hi> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally came in; and People came alſo from <hi>Connecticut,</hi> and other parts round about. There were amongſt them <hi>four Juſtices</hi> of the <hi>Peace;</hi> and moſt of theſe <hi>People</hi> were ſuch, as had never <hi>heard Friends</hi> before: but they were mightily <hi>affected</hi> with the <hi>Meeting;</hi> and a great <hi>Deſire</hi> there is after the <hi>Truth</hi> amongſt that <hi>People:</hi> So that our <hi>Meeting</hi> was of very good <hi>Service;</hi> bleſſed be the <hi>Lord</hi> for ever! The <hi>Juſtice,</hi> at whoſe <hi>Houſe</hi> the <hi>Meeting</hi> was, and another <hi>Juſtice</hi> of that <hi>Country,</hi> invited me to come again; but I was then <hi>clear</hi> of thoſe parts, and was going off towards <hi>Shelter-Iſland.</hi> But <hi>John Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yeate</hi> and <hi>John Cartwright,</hi> being come back out of <hi>New-England</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Road-Iſland,</hi> before I was gone, I laid this place before them; and they felt <hi>Drawings</hi> thither, and went to viſit them. At another <hi>place,</hi> I heard, ſome of the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> ſhould ſay among themſelves; <hi>If they had Money enough, they would hire me to be their Miniſter.</hi> This was, where they did not well underſtand <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s,</hi> and our <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples:</hi> But when I heard of it, I ſaid, <q>It was time for me to be gone: for if their <hi>Eye</hi> was ſo much to <hi>Me,</hi> or any of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s,</hi> they would not come to their own <hi>Teacher.</hi>
               </q> For this thing (of <hi>hiring Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi>) had ſpoiled many, by <hi>hindring</hi> them from improving their own <hi>Talents;</hi> whereas our Labour is, to bring every one to their own <hi>Teacher</hi> in themſelves.</p>
            <p>Now, after we had had very good <hi>Service</hi> for the <hi>Lord</hi> in <hi>Road-Iſland,</hi> and the <hi>Parts</hi> adjacent, and that <hi>John Burneyate,</hi> with the other <hi>Friends,</hi> that went from the <hi>General Meeting</hi> here into <hi>New-England,</hi> were returned hither again, I went off from hence to <hi>Shelter-Iſland;</hi> having with me <hi>Robert Widders, James Lancaſter, George Pattiſon</hi> and one <hi>John Jay,</hi> a <hi>Planter</hi> in <hi>Barbados:</hi> and leaving <hi>John Stubbs</hi>

In the freſh <hi>Openings</hi> whereof I was moved to declare of <hi>Three Eſtates,</hi> and <hi>Three Teachers,</hi> viz. <q>That <hi>God</hi> was the <hi>first Teacher</hi> of <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Woman</hi> in <hi>Paradiſe:</hi> And as long as they kept to, and under <hi>God's Teaching,</hi> they kept in the <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and in his <hi>Likeneſs,</hi> in <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Holineſs,</hi> and in <hi>Dominion</hi> over all, that <hi>God</hi> had made; in the <hi>bleſſed State,</hi> in the <hi>Paradiſe</hi> of God. But when they heark'ned to the <hi>Serpent's falſe Teaching</hi> (who was out of <hi>Truth</hi>) and diſobeyed God, and obeyed the <hi>Serpent,</hi> in feeding upon that, which God forbad them; then they loſt the <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Holineſs,</hi> and came under the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Satan,</hi> and were turned out of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> out of the <hi>Bleſſed</hi> into the <hi>Curſed State.</hi> And then the <hi>Promiſe</hi> of <hi>God</hi> was, <hi>That the Seed of the Woman ſhould bruiſe the Serpent's Head,</hi> and break his <hi>Power</hi> that Man and Woman were under, and deſtroy his <hi>Works.</hi> So here were <hi>Three States,</hi> and <hi>Three Teachers. God</hi> was the <hi>first Teacher</hi> in <hi>Paradiſe:</hi> and whilſt <hi>Man</hi> kept under his <hi>Teaching,</hi> he was <hi>happy.</hi> The <hi>Serpent</hi> was the <hi>Second Teacher:</hi> and when Man followed his <hi>Teaching,</hi> he came into <hi>Miſery,</hi> and into the <hi>Fall,</hi> from the <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Holineſs,</hi> and from the <hi>Power,</hi> that he had over all, that <hi>God</hi> had made; and came under the <hi>Serpent,</hi> whom he had <hi>Power</hi> over before. <hi>Christ Jeſus</hi> was

But I told them, <q>I was never in <hi>Ill Behaviour</hi> in my Life; and that they, the <hi>Four Judges</hi> might as well put the <hi>Oath</hi> to me there, as ſend me to <hi>Worceſter</hi> to be <hi>enſnared</hi> by the <hi>Juſtices,</hi> in their putting the <hi>Oath</hi> to me, and then <hi>premuniring</hi> me, who never took <hi>Oath</hi> in my Life.

               </q> This <hi>Alteration</hi> of the <hi>Judges</hi> Minds in my <hi>Caſe</hi> proceeded (as was thought) from ſome <hi>falſe Informations,</hi> that my <hi>Adverſary</hi> Juſtice <hi>Parker</hi> had given againſt me: For between the times of my former <hi>Appearance</hi> and this, he had ſpread abroad a very falſe and malicious <hi>Story, viz. That there were many ſubſtantial men with me, out of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts of the Nation, when he took me, and that we had a Deſign or</hi> Plot <hi>in hand; and that</hi> Thomas Lower <hi>ſtayed with me in Priſon, long after he was ſet at Liberty, to carry on our Deſign.</hi> This was ſpoken in the <hi>Parliament-Houſe;</hi> inſomuch, that if I had not been brought up to <hi>London,</hi> when I was, I had been <hi>ſtopped</hi> at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> had been <hi>Recommitted</hi> with me. But although theſe <hi>Lies</hi> were eaſily diſproved, and laid open to <hi>Parker</hi>'s <hi>Shame,</hi> yet would not the <hi>Judges</hi> alter their laſt <hi>Sentence;</hi> but remanded me to <hi>Worceſter-Jail:</hi> only this <hi>Favour</hi> was granted, that I might go down my own <hi>Way,</hi> and at my own <hi>Leiſure;</hi> provided, I would be without fail there by the <hi>Aſſize,</hi> which was to begin on the <hi>Second Day</hi> of the <hi>Second Month</hi> next following.</p>
            <p>So I ſtayed in and about <hi>London,</hi> till toward the <hi>latter End</hi> of the <hi>First Month</hi> 1674, and then went down leiſurely (for I was not able to abide haſty and hard <hi>Travel;</hi>

            <p>Another time there came a <hi>Common-Prayer-Prieſt,</hi> and ſome <hi>People</hi> with him; and he asked me, <hi>If I was grown up to Perfection?</hi> I told him; 'What I was, I was by the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> He replied, <hi>It was a modest and civil Anſwer.</hi> Then he urged the Words of <hi>John; If we ſay, that we have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves, and the Truth is not in us:</hi> And he asked, <hi>What did I ſay to that?</hi>

               </q> He ſaid, <hi>It was their Form.</hi> I ſaid, 'It was not a <hi>true Form.</hi> He asked me again, <hi>Whether I was Guilty?</hi> I told him, <q>Nay, I was not <hi>Guilty</hi> of the <hi>Matter,</hi> nor of the <hi>Form:</hi> for I was againſt the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Popery,</hi> and did acknowledge, and ſhould ſet my <hi>Hand</hi> to that.</q> Then the <hi>Judge</hi> told the <hi>Jury,</hi> what they ſhould <hi>ſay,</hi> and what they ſhould <hi>do,</hi> and what they ſhould <hi>write</hi> on the <hi>Back-ſide</hi> of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment;</hi> and as he ſaid, they did. But before the <hi>Jury</hi> gave in their <hi>Verdict,</hi> I ſpake to them, and told them, <q>That it was for <hi>Chriſt's ſake,</hi> and in Obedience to his and his Apoſtle's <hi>Command,</hi> that I could not <hi>ſwear:</hi> and therefore (ſaid I) take heed, what ye do; for before his <hi>Judgment-Seat</hi> ye ſhall all be brought.</q> The <hi>Judge</hi> ſaid, <hi>This is Canting,</hi> (a <hi>baſe Word!</hi>) I ſaid, <q>If to <hi>Confeſs Christ</hi> our Lord and Saviour, and to obey his Command, be called <hi>Canting</hi> by a <hi>Judge</hi> of a <hi>Court,</hi> it is to little purpoſe for me to ſay more among you: Yet ye ſhall ſee, that I am a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and ſhall ſhew forth <hi>Chriſtianity;</hi> and my <hi>Innocency</hi> ſhall be manifeſt.</q> So the <hi>Jailer</hi> led me out of the <hi>Court;</hi> and the People were generally <hi>Tender,</hi> like as if they had been

               </q> The <hi>Judge</hi> ſaid, <hi>The</hi> Oath <hi>hath been tendered to you ſeveral times; and we will have ſome Satisfaction from you concerning the</hi> Oath. <q>I offered them the ſame <hi>Declaration</hi> inſtead of the <hi>Oath,</hi> which I had offered to the <hi>Judges</hi> above; but it would not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</q> Then I deſired to know, <q>Seeing they put the <hi>Oath</hi> a-new to me, whether the <hi>Indictment</hi> was <hi>quaſhed,</hi> or no?</q> Inſtead of anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me, the <hi>Judge</hi> told the <hi>Jury, They might go out.</hi> Some of the <hi>Jury</hi> were not <hi>ſatisfied;</hi> whereupon the <hi>Judge</hi> told them, <hi>They had heard a Man Swear, that the</hi> Oath <hi>was tendered to me the</hi> laſt Seſſions: and then he told them, what they ſhould do.

               </q> However, the <hi>Jury,</hi> being put on by him, went forth; and ſoon after came in again, and <hi>found</hi> me <hi>Guilty.</hi> I ſpake to the <hi>Jury,</hi> and asked them, <q>How they could ſatisfie themſelves to find me <hi>Guilty</hi> upon that <hi>Indictment,</hi> which was laid ſo <hi>falſe,</hi> and had ſo many <hi>Errors</hi> in it?

               </q> He would not anſwer that, but ſaid; <hi>Would you had never come here, to trouble us and the Country!</hi> I told him, <q>I came not thither of my ſelf, but was <hi>brought,</hi> being ſtopped in my <hi>Travel</hi> on my <hi>Journey;</hi> and I did not <hi>trouble</hi> them, but they had brought <hi>Trouble</hi> upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</q> Then the <hi>Judge</hi> told me, <hi>What a ſad Sentence</hi> he had to <hi>tell me.</hi> I asked him, <q>
                  <hi>Whether</hi> what he was going to ſpeak, was by way of <hi>paſſing Sentence,</hi> or by way of <hi>Information?</hi> For, I told him, I had many things to ſay, and more <hi>Errors</hi> to Aſſign in the <hi>Indictment</hi> (beſides thoſe I had already mentioned) to ſtop him from <hi>giving Sentence</hi> againſt me upon that <hi>Indictment.</hi>
               </q> He ſaid, <hi>He was going to ſhew me the danger of a</hi> Premunire, <hi>which was the Loſs of my Liberty, and of all my Goods and Chattels; and to endure Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment during Life.</hi> But he ſaid, <hi>He did not deliver this, as the</hi> Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence <hi>of the Court upon me; but as an Admonition to me:</hi> and then he bid the <hi>Jailer, Take me away.</hi> I expected to have been <hi>called</hi> again, to hear the <hi>Sentence;</hi> but when I was gone, the <hi>Clerk</hi> of the <hi>Peace,</hi> (whoſe Name was <hi>Twittey</hi>) asked him, (as I was informed) <hi>Whether that, which he had ſpoken to me, ſhould ſtand for</hi> Sentence?

This Juſtice <hi>Street</hi> ſaid to ſome <hi>Friends</hi> in the Morning before my <hi>Trial, That if he had been upon the Bench the firſt</hi> Seſſions, <hi>he would not have tendered me the</hi> Oath: <hi>but if I had been Convicted of being at a</hi> Conventicle, <hi>he would have proceeded against me according to that Law; and that he was ſorry, that ever I came before him:</hi> And yet he maliciouſly tendered the <hi>Oath</hi> to me in the <hi>Court</hi> again, when I was to have <hi>Tried</hi> my <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe</hi> upon the <hi>Indictment.</hi> But the <hi>Lord</hi> pleaded my <hi>Cauſe,</hi> and met with both him and Juſtice <hi>Simpſon,</hi> who firſt <hi>enſnared</hi> me with the <hi>Oath</hi> at the <hi>firſt Seſſions:</hi> For <hi>Simpſon</hi>'s <hi>Son</hi> was Arraigned not long after, at the ſame <hi>Bar</hi> for <hi>Murder.</hi> And <hi>Street,</hi> who, as he came down from <hi>London,</hi> (after the <hi>Judges</hi> had returned me back from the <hi>King's-Bench</hi> to <hi>Worceſter,</hi> ſaid; <hi>Now I was returned to them, I ſhould lie in Priſon, and rot:</hi> had his <hi>Daughter,</hi> (whom he ſo <hi>doted</hi> on, that ſhe was called his <hi>Idol</hi>) brought down <hi>dead</hi> from <hi>London</hi> in an <hi>Hearſe,</hi> to the ſame <hi>Inn,</hi> where he <hi>ſpake thoſe Words;</hi> and brought to <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter</hi> to be <hi>buried</hi> within a few days after.

            <p>After I was carried back to <hi>Priſon,</hi> ſeveral came to ſee me, and amongſt others, the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Salisbury</hi>'s <hi>Son;</hi> who was very loving, and troubled, that they had <hi>dealt ſo badly</hi> by me.

<pb n="405" facs="tcp:51448:292"/> could not obtain, what ſhe deſired; for he ſaid, <hi>The</hi> King <hi>could not Releaſe me otherwiſe, than by a Pardon:</hi> And I was not free to receive a <hi>Pardon,</hi> knowing, I had not done <hi>Evil.</hi> And if I would have been freed by a <hi>Pardon,</hi> I needed not have lain ſo <hi>long;</hi> for the <hi>King</hi> was willing to have given me a <hi>Pardon</hi> long before, and told <hi>Thomas Moore,</hi> that <hi>I need not ſcruple being Releaſed by a</hi> Pardon; <hi>for many a Man, that was as Innocent as a Child, had had a</hi> Pardon <hi>granted him:</hi> Yet I could not Conſent to have one.

The <hi>Clerk</hi> had been my <hi>Enemy</hi> all along; and now ſought to <hi>Enſnare</hi> me in <hi>Diſcourſe:</hi> but I ſaw, and ſhunned him.

Then he asked me, <hi>What I thought of the Church of</hi> England? <hi>Was there no</hi> Chriſtians <hi>among them?</hi> I ſaid, <q>They are all <hi>called</hi> ſo; and there are many <hi>tender People</hi> amongſt them.<note place="margin">London.</note>

Whereupon the Chief Juſtice <hi>Hales</hi> ſaid, <hi>Mr.</hi> Corbet, <hi>You ſhould have come ſooner, at the beginning of the Term with this Plea:</hi> He Anſwered, <hi>We could not get a Copy of the</hi> Return, <hi>and of the Indictment.</hi> The <hi>Judge</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied; <hi>You ſhould have told us, and we would have forced them to have made a</hi> Return <hi>ſooner.</hi> Then ſaid Judge <hi>Wild, Mr.</hi> Corbet, <hi>you go upon General Terms; and if it be ſo, as you ſay, we have Committed many Errors at the</hi> Old Baily, <hi>and in other Courts.

                  <p>WHom the <hi>Lord</hi> hath preſerved by his <hi>Eternal Power</hi> to this Day, over and through many <hi>Troubles, Storms,</hi> and <hi>Tempeſts,</hi> and <hi>Priſons;</hi> and therefore let every one's <hi>Faith</hi> ſtand in the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which is over the <hi>Devil,</hi> and before he was. So your <hi>Faith</hi> ſtanding in the <hi>Inviſible Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> it ſtands in that, which does not <hi>change;</hi> and the <hi>Faith,</hi> that <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> is the <hi>Author</hi> of, it muſt ſtand in the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God:</hi> So then it ſtands in that, which is over all; in which they are eſtabliſhed. And this the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> brought the <hi>Church</hi> and the <hi>true Chriſtians</hi> to: And ſo ought all the <hi>true Chriſtians Faith</hi> now, which Chriſt is the <hi>Author</hi> of, it muſt ſtand in the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> in which <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Kingdom</hi> ſtands: and ſo as every one's <hi>Faith</hi> ſtands in the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> this keeps all in the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Godlineſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For as it was in the <hi>Days</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> when ſome was crying up <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Apollos</hi> (and ſo forth) he judged them as <hi>Carnal;</hi> and exhorted them, and admoniſhed them, that their <hi>Faith ſhould ſtand in the Power of God.</hi> So it was not to <hi>ſtand in Men,</hi> nor in the <hi>Words</hi> of <hi>Man's Wiſdom;</hi> but in the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God:</hi> And he ſaid, <hi>He would not know the</hi> Speech <hi>of them, but the</hi> Power <hi>amongst them; for the Kingdom of God is not in</hi> Word, <hi>but in</hi> Power. And ſo it is to be now: Every one's <hi>Faith</hi> muſt ſtand in the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and not in <hi>Men,</hi> nor their <hi>Speeches</hi> of the <hi>good Words.</hi> For we have ſeen by <hi>Experience,</hi> when they begin to <hi>cry up Men,</hi> and their <hi>Faith</hi> to ſtand in them; ſuch <hi>Men,</hi> as would have Peoples <hi>Faith</hi> ſtand in them, loves <hi>Popularity,</hi> and brings not <hi>People</hi>'s <hi>Faith</hi> to ſtand in the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> and ſuch cannot <hi>exalt Christ:</hi> And when ſuch <hi>fall,</hi> they <hi>draw</hi> a great <hi>Company</hi> after them. And therefore the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> would not know ſuch after the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> but would know them, that were in the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Spirit;</hi> and ſtruck down every one's <hi>Faith,</hi> that ſtood in the <hi>Words</hi> of <hi>Man's Wiſdom,</hi> that they might ſtand in the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God:</hi> And ſo it muſt be now. And all, whoſe <hi>Faith</hi> doth not ſtand in the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> they cannot <hi>Exalt</hi> his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> that ſtands in <hi>Power;</hi> and therefore every one's <hi>Faith</hi> muſt ſtand in the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the Apoſtle denied <hi>Popularity,</hi> when he Judged the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> for <hi>looking at</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Apollos, <hi>to be Carnal;</hi> and ſuch are <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> ſtill: And therefore all ſhould know one another in the <hi>Spirit, Life</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> and look at Chriſt; and this keeps all <hi>low</hi> and <hi>down</hi> in the <hi>Humility.</hi> And they, whoſe <hi>Faith</hi> ſtands in <hi>Men,</hi> will make <hi>Sects:</hi> as in the Days of <hi>J. N.</hi> and <hi>J. P.</hi> and ſince in others: And ſuch their <hi>Faith</hi> Chriſt is not the <hi>Author</hi> of; and if he be, they have <hi>erred from it, and made Shipwrack of it.</hi> And all thoſe, that are in the <hi>True Faith,</hi> that ſtands in the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> they will <hi>Judge</hi> them as <hi>Carnal,</hi> and <hi>Judge down</hi> that <hi>Carnal Part</hi> in them, that cries up <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>Apollos;</hi> that their <hi>Faith</hi> may ſtand in the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi>
                     <pb n="410" facs="tcp:51448:295"/> and that they may <hi>Exalt Christ,</hi> the <hi>Author</hi> of it. For every one's <hi>Eye</hi> ought to be to <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>Finiſher</hi> of their <hi>Faith;</hi> and every <hi>Juſt Man</hi> and <hi>Woman</hi> may live by their <hi>Faith,</hi> which <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Christ</hi> is the <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>Finiſher</hi> of: And by this <hi>Faith</hi> every <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Woman</hi> may <hi>ſee God,</hi> who is <hi>Inviſible;</hi> which <hi>Faith</hi> gives the <hi>Victory,</hi> by which he hath <hi>Acceſs</hi> to <hi>God.</hi> And ſo every one's <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> ſtanding in the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> in it they all have <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> and <hi>Victory,</hi> and Acceſs to <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Throne</hi> of <hi>Grace;</hi> in which <hi>Faith</hi> they do pleaſe God, which Chriſt is the <hi>Author</hi> of. And ſo by that <hi>Faith</hi> they are <hi>Saved:</hi> and by this <hi>Faith</hi> they obtain the <hi>good Report,</hi> and ſubdue all the <hi>Mountains,</hi> that have been betwixt them and God.</p>
                  <p>So that <hi>Power</hi> hath kept and preſerved <hi>Friends</hi> over their <hi>Perſecutors,</hi> and over the <hi>Wrath</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> and above the <hi>Spoilings</hi> of their <hi>Goods,</hi> and <hi>Impriſonments;</hi> as <hi>ſeeing God,</hi> that hath <hi>created all, and gives the Encreaſe of all; and upholds all by his Word and Power.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let every one's <hi>Faith</hi> be in his Power: And here in this no <hi>Schiſm</hi> or <hi>Sect</hi> can come, for it is over them, and before they were; and will be, when they are gone. But <hi>perfect <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> is in the <hi>Truth</hi> and in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> that does <hi>Circumciſe</hi> the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Death,</hi> and that puts off the <hi>Sins</hi> of the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and plunges it down with the <hi>Spirit:</hi> And in the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> there is a <hi>perfect Fellowſhip;</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> is the <hi>Miniſter</hi> of this <hi>Circumciſion</hi> and <hi>Baptiſm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So this is upon me from the <hi>Lord,</hi> to write unto you all, that every one of your <hi>Faith,</hi> that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the <hi>Author</hi> of, may ſtand in the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God:</hi> and from the <hi>Lord</hi> I do warn you, and all every where to the <hi>ſame.</hi> For if a <hi>Star</hi> ſhould fall, which has been a <hi>Light,</hi> either the <hi>Earth</hi> or the <hi>Sea</hi> does receive it; that is, the <hi>Earthly Mind,</hi> or the <hi>foaming, raging</hi> People: Though neither the <hi>Seed,</hi> nor <hi>Light,</hi> nor <hi>Power,</hi> nor <hi>Truth</hi> ever fell, nor the <hi>Faith</hi> it ſelf, the <hi>Gift</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> but <hi>Men</hi> going from it, then they become <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſavoury.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For <hi>Adam,</hi> whilſt he kept in <hi>Truth,</hi> and obeyed the <hi>Command</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> he was happy: but when he diſobeyed the <hi>Lord,</hi> he fell under the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Satan,</hi> and became unhappy, though he might talk af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his <hi>Experiences</hi> in <hi>Paradice;</hi> but he had loſt his <hi>Image,</hi> and his <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Dominion,</hi> that God Created him in.</p>
                  <p>And the <hi>Jews,</hi> after they received the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> as long as they kept the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which was <hi>just, holy, good</hi> and <hi>perfect,</hi> it kept them <hi>good, juſt, and holy,</hi> and <hi>ſavoury;</hi> but when they turned their Backs off the <hi>Lord,</hi> and forſook his <hi>Law,</hi> then they came under the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> and under the <hi>Powers</hi> of the <hi>Earth,</hi> and were trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den under, as <hi>unſavoury.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſo the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> they were called a <hi>City ſet on a Hill,</hi> The <hi>Light</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> and the <hi>Salt</hi> of the <hi>Earth:</hi> but when they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and their <hi>Faith</hi> ſtood in <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Men,</hi> and not in the <hi>Power;</hi> then their <hi>Walls</hi> fell down, though the <hi>Power</hi> in it ſelf ſtood: and they <hi>lost</hi> their <hi>Hill,</hi> and their <hi>Saltneſs,</hi> and their <hi>Shining.</hi> And ſo as <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> now does confeſs, they are not in the ſame <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> as the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were in; ſo not in the ſame <hi>Salt,</hi> nor upon the ſame <hi>Hill.</hi> So they came to be <hi>trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
                     <pb n="411" facs="tcp:51448:295"/> under, and the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and the <hi>Whore,</hi> and the <hi>falſe Prophet</hi> are uppermoſt; the <hi>unſavoury.</hi> So their <hi>Dead Faith</hi> is in <hi>Men,</hi> and in <hi>Words;</hi> and therefore they are full of <hi>Sects,</hi> and one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>And now the <hi>Everlaſting Goſpel,</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is preacht again, which was before the <hi>Devil</hi> was, that had darkned Man; and by this <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Goſpel, Life</hi> and <hi>Immortality</hi> is come to light again. And therefore every one's <hi>Faith</hi> is to ſtand in this <hi>Power,</hi> the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> that hath brought <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Immortality</hi> to Light in them; and ſo to be Heirs of the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> And here have all Men and Women a <hi>Right</hi> to the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> before the <hi>Devil</hi> was: and the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Mens</hi>- and the <hi>Womens-Meetings,</hi> and of all the other <hi>Meetings</hi> ſet up thereby.</p>
                  <p>But now as the <hi>Goſpel</hi> is preacht again, if your <hi>Faith</hi> doth not ſtand in the <hi>Power,</hi> but in <hi>Men,</hi> and in the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of <hi>Words,</hi> you will grow <hi>Carnal;</hi> and ſuch are for <hi>Judgment,</hi> who cry up, as they did, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Apollos,</hi> and not <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Author</hi> of your <hi>Faith.</hi> And them that loves to be <hi>Popular,</hi> would have <hi>People</hi>'s <hi>Faith</hi> to ſtand <hi>in them;</hi> and ſuch do not <hi>preach Chriſt,</hi> but <hi>themſelves.</hi> But ſuch as <hi>preach Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Goſpel,</hi> would have every <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Woman</hi> to be in the <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> of it; and ſo to have every <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Woman</hi>'s <hi>Faith</hi> to ſtand in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Author</hi> of it, and in the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which was before the <hi>Devil</hi> was; and it will be, when he is gone. And their <hi>Faith</hi> ſtanding in the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> then nothing can get betwixt them and God: For if any ſhould <hi>fall</hi> amongſt us, as too many have done; then that leads its <hi>Followers</hi> either into the <hi>Waters,</hi> or into the <hi>Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if any ſhould go from the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> that did <hi>open</hi> to them, and from the <hi>Power;</hi> they may ſpeak their <hi>Experiences,</hi> which the <hi>Power</hi> hath <hi>opened</hi> to them formerly. And ſo might <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve ſpeak,</hi> of what they <hi>ſaw</hi> and <hi>enjoyed</hi> in <hi>Paradiſe;</hi> and ſo might <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Balaam,</hi> of what they <hi>ſaw;</hi> and alſo the <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Corah,</hi> and <hi>Dathan,</hi> who praiſed God on the <hi>Banks,</hi> and ſaw the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory</hi> over <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and they ate of the <hi>Manna,</hi> and drank of the <hi>Rock,</hi> and came to Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and ſaw the <hi>Glory</hi> of the <hi>Lord.</hi> And ſo alſo might the <hi>falſe Apoſtles</hi> ſpeak of their <hi>Experiences;</hi> and all thoſe <hi>falſe Chriſtians,</hi> that turned from the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And ſo may ſuch do now, that <hi>err from the Spirit,</hi> that are come out of <hi>Egypt</hi> (in <hi>Spirit</hi>) and <hi>Sodom,</hi> and have known the <hi>Raging</hi> of the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> as <hi>Lot</hi> did the <hi>outward;</hi> and the <hi>Purſuit</hi> of the <hi>Spiritual Egyptians,</hi> as the <hi>outward Jew</hi> did of the <hi>outward Egyptians:</hi> yet if they do not <hi>Walk</hi> in the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and in the <hi>Light,</hi> and in the <hi>Grace,</hi> which keeps their Hearts ſtabliſhed, and their Words ſeaſoned, and alſo their <hi>Faith</hi> to ſtand in the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> in which the <hi>Kingdom</hi> ſtands; they may go forth like the <hi>falſe Chriſtians,</hi> and like the <hi>Jews,</hi> and like <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> and <hi>Cain,</hi> and <hi>Corah,</hi> and <hi>Balaam,</hi> and be <hi>wandring Stars, Trees</hi> without <hi>Fruit,</hi> and <hi>Wells</hi> without <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and <hi>Clouds</hi> without <hi>Rain:</hi> and ſo come to be <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſavoury,</hi> and trodden down. And as <hi>Adam</hi> who loſt <hi>Paradiſe;</hi> and the <hi>Jews,</hi> who loſt the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> not walking in the <hi>Law,</hi> and keeping the <hi>Command</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> and as the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who loſt the <hi>City,</hi> and the

                     <hi>Hill,</hi> and the <hi>Salt,</hi> and the <hi>Light</hi> ſince the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s <hi>Days,</hi> and came to be <hi>unſavoury,</hi> and to be trodden under foot of Men.</p>
                  <p>And therefore let every one's <hi>Faith</hi> ſtand, as I ſaid before, in the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Power,</hi> which is over all, through which they may be built upon the <hi>Rock,</hi> and the <hi>Foundation</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Seed Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> that <hi>bruiſes</hi> the <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Serpent;</hi> who was before he was, and will be, when he is gone: who is the <hi>Head</hi> of his <hi>Church.</hi> So that all in <hi>Chriſt</hi> may be always <hi>freſh</hi> and <hi>green;</hi> for he is the <hi>green Tree</hi> that never <hi>withers:</hi> and all are <hi>freſh</hi> and <hi>green,</hi> that are grafted into him: and abide in him <hi>freſh</hi> and <hi>green,</hi> and bring forth <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, freſh Fruits</hi> to the Praiſe of God. And though <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> fell from <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> fell from the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and many of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> fell from their <hi>Prophecies,</hi> and <hi>erred</hi> from the <hi>Faith,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and the <hi>Grace;</hi> and the <hi>Stars</hi> have <hi>fallen,</hi> as was ſpoken of in the <hi>Revelations:</hi> yet the <hi>Spirit, Grace, Faith</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God</hi> remains.</p>
                  <p>And many ſuch <hi>States</hi> have I ſeen within this <hi>Twenty Eight Years;</hi> though there is a <hi>State,</hi> that ſhall <hi>never fall,</hi> nor be <hi>deceived</hi> in the <hi>Elect,</hi> before the <hi>World</hi> began: who are come to the <hi>End</hi> of the <hi>Prophecies,</hi> and are in <hi>him,</hi> where they <hi>end,</hi> and renewed up into the <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>God</hi> (by Chriſt) which <hi>Man</hi> was in, before he <hi>fell;</hi> in that <hi>Power,</hi> where he had Dominion over all, that <hi>God</hi> made: and not only ſo, but <hi>Attain to a perfect Man, unto the meaſure of the Stature of the fulneſs of Chriſt,</hi> who never fell.

                  <p>So all <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Women,</hi> that be <hi>Heirs</hi> of this <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> it is their <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> and <hi>Portion;</hi> and they are to labour in their <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> and <hi>Portion,</hi> and to do <hi>God Almighty's buſineſs</hi> and <hi>Service</hi> in the <hi>Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion</hi> of the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> which is a <hi>Joyful, Glorious, Everlaſting Order.</hi> And here is the <hi>Authority</hi> of our <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's Meetings,</hi> and other <hi>Meetings</hi> in the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> which is not of <hi>Man,</hi> nor by <hi>Man:</hi> and in <hi>this</hi> they are all to <hi>Meet,</hi> and to <hi>Worſhip God;</hi> and by this they are all to <hi>act,</hi> and in this <hi>Power</hi> they have all <hi>Fellowſhip,</hi> a <hi>Joyful Fellowſhip,</hi> a <hi>Joyful</hi> and <hi>Comfortable Aſſembly.</hi> And ſo this is the <hi>Day</hi> in the <hi>Eternal Light,</hi> that all are to take their <hi>Poſſeſſions</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> and its <hi>Order,</hi> that <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which they are <hi>Heirs</hi> of.

                  </p>
                  <p>So here is <hi>God's Choice</hi> (and not <hi>Man</hi>'s) by his <hi>Power</hi> of his <hi>Heirs,</hi> and they have all <hi>Freedom</hi> in this <hi>Goſpel,</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> to go to the <hi>Meetings,</hi> the <hi>Men</hi> to the <hi>Mens,</hi> and the <hi>Women</hi> to the <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens;</hi> for they are <hi>Heirs</hi> of the <hi>Power,</hi> which <hi>Power</hi> is the <hi>Goſpel</hi> not of <hi>Man,</hi> nor by <hi>Man,</hi> but from <hi>Heaven,</hi> ſent by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and received in the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> which hath brought <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Immortality</hi> to <hi>Light</hi> in them, and they ſee over <hi>Enmity,</hi> and before it was, by the <hi>Light,</hi> and the <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>Immortality,</hi> which is brought to <hi>Light</hi> in them.</p>
                  <p>So the <hi>Devil,</hi> the <hi>Author</hi> of <hi>Enmity,</hi> cannot get into this <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> nor <hi>Order,</hi> nor <hi>Fellowſhip</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> nor <hi>Life,</hi> nor <hi>Light,</hi> nor the <hi>Fellowſhip</hi> in the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> nor into the <hi>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> over him. And therefore, as I ſaid before, let every one's <hi>Faith</hi> ſtand in the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Glorious Goſpel;</hi> and all to <hi>walk,</hi> as becomes the <hi>Goſpel</hi> and the <hi>Order</hi> of it: and as every one hath received <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> the <hi>Lord,</hi> ſo <hi>walk</hi> in him, and let him be their <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer.</hi> For they that do preach the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> it is to the Intent, that all might come to be <hi>Heirs</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and into the <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> of it; and to be <hi>Heirs</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and of his <hi>Government,</hi> the <hi>Encreaſe</hi> of which there is <hi>no end;</hi> who is over all in his <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and over all in his <hi>Light, Life, Power</hi> and <hi>Dominion.</hi> And therefore know one another in his <hi>Power,</hi> his <hi>Goſpel,</hi> which is the Authority of your <hi>Meetings:</hi> And know one another in <hi>Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> who is able to reſtore Man out of the <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Fall,</hi> into the <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> as he was in before he <hi>fell,</hi> and into that <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Dominion,</hi> that Man had, before he <hi>fell,</hi> and into himſelf, that never <hi>fell;</hi> where they ſhall go no more forth.

            <p>During this time alſo, I <hi>Collected</hi> together as many as I could, of the <hi>Epiſtles</hi> I had written in <hi>former Years</hi> to <hi>Friends.</hi> I made a <hi>Collection</hi> too of the ſeveral <hi>Papers,</hi> that I had written to <hi>O.

            <p>I made alſo another <hi>Collection,</hi> in <hi>Two Books; one</hi> of <hi>Epiſtles</hi> and <hi>Letters,</hi> from <hi>Friends</hi> and others, on ſeveral Occaſions to me: The <hi>other</hi> of <hi>Letters</hi> of mine to <hi>Friends</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>I writ alſo a <hi>Book</hi> of the <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Figures</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> with their Significations; and many other things, which will be of <hi>Service</hi> to <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Friends</hi> in times to come.</p>
            <p>I took notice alſo of thoſe, who had <hi>run out</hi> from <hi>Truth,</hi> and drawn others out after them, and turned againſt <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Friends</hi> at ſeveral times, ſince the <hi>First Breaking forth</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> in this <hi>latter Age,</hi> and what became of them; noting particularly the <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Return</hi> of ſuch of them, as came back to <hi>Truth</hi> again.

For to <hi>Reſiſt</hi> the <hi>Heavenly Power,</hi> and to oppoſe the <hi>Workings</hi> and Divine <hi>Manifeſtations</hi> thereof through any, is not a <hi>light Matter.</hi> And as I had been moved of the Lord, to travel in his <hi>Power</hi> round about this <hi>Nation,</hi> and in other <hi>Parts,</hi> to <hi>preach</hi> the <hi>Everlaſting Goſpel,</hi> and to declare the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> which was in the <hi>Beginning,</hi> through many <hi>Impriſonments, Hardſhips, Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings</hi> and <hi>Trials;</hi> ſo I was afterwards moved to <hi>Travel</hi> in the ſame Heavenly <hi>Power</hi> about the <hi>Nation</hi> again (and to <hi>write</hi> to ſuch <hi>Places,</hi> where I came not) to recommend unto <hi>Friends</hi> the <hi>ſetting up of the</hi> Quarterly <hi>and</hi> Monthly Meetings <hi>in all Counties, for the looking after the</hi> Poor, <hi>and taking Care for</hi> Orderly Proceedings <hi>in</hi> Marriages. <hi>and other matters relating to the</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> Chriſt: Though ſome <hi>Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> for this end were ſettled in the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>England</hi> in the Year 1653.</p>
            <p>And after this alſo, <hi>Truth</hi> ſtill ſpreading further over the <hi>Nation,</hi> and <hi>Friends</hi> encreaſing in number, I was moved by the ſame <hi>Eternal Power</hi> to recommend the ſetting up the <hi>Womens-Meetings</hi> alſo; that all, both <hi>Male</hi> and <hi>Female,</hi> that had received the <hi>Goſpel</hi> the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Eternal Life,</hi> might come into the <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> brought forth by the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and might act for <hi>God</hi> in the <hi>Power,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in do <hi>Buſineſs</hi> and <hi>Service</hi> for him in his <hi>Church.</hi> All the <hi>Faithful</hi> muſt labour in <hi>God's Vineyard;</hi> they being his <hi>Hired Servants,</hi> and he having given them the <hi>Earneſt</hi> of his <hi>Spirit.</hi> For a <hi>Maſter,</hi> that hires a <hi>Servant,</hi> and gives him the <hi>Earneſt</hi> of his <hi>Hire,</hi> expects, he ſhould do his <hi>Work,</hi> after he knows his <hi>Will,</hi> in the outward Creation: So all <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Prople,</hi> that be of the <hi>new Creation,</hi> and have received the <hi>Earneſt</hi> of his <hi>Spirit,</hi> ought to labour with, by and in his <hi>Spirit, Power</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> in the <hi>Light,</hi> in <hi>God's Vineyard,</hi> that they may have their <hi>Wages</hi> every one, <hi>Male</hi> and <hi>Female,</hi> when they have done <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Work</hi> and <hi>Buſineſs</hi> in his <hi>Day,</hi> which is <hi>Eternal Life.</hi> But none can labour in his <hi>Vineyard,</hi> and do his <hi>Work</hi> and <hi>Will,</hi> but as they walk in the Heavenly Divine <hi>Light, Grace</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> which is, hath been and is my <hi>Travel</hi> and <hi>Labour</hi> in the Lord to turn all to.</p>

            <p>In this Year, while I was at <hi>Swarthmore,</hi> died <hi>William Lampit,</hi> the old <hi>Priest</hi> of <hi>

He had been an old <hi>falſe Prophet:</hi> for in the Year 1652. he <hi>Propheſied</hi> (and ſaid, he would <hi>Wage</hi> his <hi>Life</hi> upon it) <hi>That the</hi> Quakers <hi>would all vaniſh, and come to nought within half a year:</hi> But he <hi>came to nought</hi> himſelf. For he continued in his <hi>Lying</hi> and <hi>falſe Accuſing</hi> of <hi>God's People,</hi> till a little before he <hi>died;</hi> and then he cried for a <hi>little Rest:</hi> And to one of his <hi>Hearers,</hi> that came to

            <p>Thus it pleaſed the Lord to bring me ſafe to <hi>London,</hi> though much wearied with Travel: for though I rode not very far in a day, yet having had much weakneſs of Body, continual Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel was hard to me. Beſides, I had not much reſt a-nights to refreſh Nature: for I often ſate late up with <hi>Friends,</hi> where I lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to Inform and Adviſe them in things, wherein they were wanting; and when I was in bed, I was often hindred of ſleep by great <hi>pains,</hi> which I felt in my <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Teeth,</hi> occaſioned (as I thought) by <hi>Cold</hi> I had taken, by riding often in the Rain.

            <p>I came to <hi>London</hi> on the 23th of the <hi>Third Month,</hi> ſome <hi>Ten</hi> or <hi>Twelve</hi> days before the <hi>Yearly Meeting;</hi> in which time I fell in with Friends there in the <hi>Service</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> viſiting them at the <hi>Meetings:</hi> And the <hi>Parliament</hi> then ſitting, we prepared ſomething to lay before them, concerning the <hi>ſeizing</hi> of the <hi>Third part</hi> of <hi>Friends Eſtates,</hi> as <hi>Popiſh Recuſants;</hi> which was a great Suffering, and a Grievance we Complained of; but no <hi>Redreſs</hi> we got.</p>

            <p>To the <hi>Yearly Meeting</hi> many Friends came from moſt parts of the Nation,<note place="margin">1677. London.

Then after the <hi>Yearly Meeting</hi> was over, and I had ſtay'd a <hi>Week</hi> or <hi>Two</hi> with <hi>Friends</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> I went down with <hi>William Penn</hi> to his houſe in <hi>Suſſex:</hi>

               <hi>John Burnyeat,</hi> and ſome other Friends went with us:<note place="margin">Surrey.</note> and as we paſſed through <hi>Surrey,</hi> hearing, that the <hi>Quarterly Meeting</hi> for that County was that day, <hi>William Penn, John Burnyeat</hi> and I went from the Road to it; and after the <hi>Meeting</hi> returning to our other Company on the Road, went on with them to <hi>William Penn</hi>'s that Night, which is <hi>Forty Miles</hi> from <hi>London.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Worming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurſt.</note> I ſtay'd at <hi>Worminghurſt</hi> about <hi>Three Weeks,</hi> in which time <hi>John Burnyeat</hi> and <hi>I</hi> (at ſuch times as we were not amongſt <hi>Friends</hi> in <hi>Meetings</hi>) Anſwered a very envious and wicked Book, which one <hi>Roger Williams</hi> a <hi>Prieſt</hi> of <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (or ſome <hi>Colony</hi> thereabouts) had written againſt <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Friends.</hi> When we had finiſhed that Service, we went with <hi>Stephen Smith</hi> (who was there with us) to his houſe at <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pledon</hi> in <hi>Surrey,</hi>

The <hi>Packet-Boat,</hi> in which we were to go, not being ready, we went to the <hi>Meeting</hi> in the <hi>Town,</hi> and a precious Opportunity we had together: for the Lord, according to his wonted goodneſs, by his over-coming, refreſhing Power, opened many Mouths to declare his Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Truth, and to praiſe and glorifie him. After the <hi>Meeting</hi> we returned to <hi>John Vandewall</hi>'s, where I had lodged, and when the <hi>Boat</hi> was ready (taking Leave of thoſe <hi>Friends,</hi> that had accompanied us thither, and that met us there) we that were bound for <hi>Holland,</hi> went on Board about the 9th hour in the Evening, on the 25th <hi>day</hi> of the 5th <hi>Month</hi> 1677.</p>

About the <hi>Firſt hour</hi> in the Morning we weighed Anchor, having a fair, brisk Wind, which by the next Morning brought us within ſight of <hi>Holland.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Holland.</note> But that day proving very clear and calm, we got forward but little, till about the <hi>Fourth</hi> hour in the <hi>Afternoon,</hi> when a freſh Gale aroſe, which carried us within a <hi>League</hi> of Land. Then being becalmed again, we caſt Anchor for that Night, it being between the hours of <hi>Nine</hi> and <hi>Ten</hi> in the Evening. But <hi>William Penn</hi> and <hi>Robert Barclay</hi> (underſtanding, that <hi>Benjamin Furly</hi> was come from <hi>Rotterdam</hi> to the <hi>Briel</hi> to meet us) got two of the <hi>Boat-men</hi> to let down a ſmall Boat, that belonged to the <hi>Packet-Boat,</hi> and Row them to ſhore: but before they could get to ſhore, the Gates were ſhut; and there being no houſe without the Gate, they were fain to lie in a <hi>Fiſher</hi>'s <hi>Boat</hi> all Night. As ſoon as the Gates were opened in the Morning, they went in, and found <hi>Benjamin Furly,</hi> with other Friends of <hi>Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdam,</hi> that were come thither to receive us; and they ſent a <hi>Boat,</hi> with three Young-men in it, that lived with <hi>Benjamin Furly,</hi> who brought us to the <hi>Briel,</hi>

            <p>We ſtay'd about <hi>Two hours</hi> at the <hi>Briel,</hi> to refreſh our ſelves; and then took Boat, with the <hi>Holland-Friends,</hi> for <hi>Rotterdam;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rotterdam</note> where we arrived about the <hi>Eleventh hour</hi> that day, which was the 28th of the <hi>Fifth Month</hi> 1677.

            <p>The next day, being the <hi>Firſt day</hi> of the <hi>Week,</hi> we had <hi>Two Meetings</hi> at <hi>Benjamin Furly</hi>'s, where many of the <hi>Towns People,</hi> and ſome <hi>Officers</hi> came in; and all were civil. <hi>Benjamin Furly,</hi> or <hi>John Claus,</hi> (a <hi>Friend</hi> of <hi>Amſterdam</hi>) interpreted, when any <hi>Friend</hi> declared.

            <p>Next day was the <hi>Quarterly Meeting</hi> at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> to which came Friends from <hi>Harlem</hi> and <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> and with them thoſe <hi>Friends</hi> of our Company, whom we had left behind at <hi>Rotter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> viz. <hi>Robert Barclay, George Keith</hi> and his <hi>Wife,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Meeting</hi> was at <hi>Gertrude Dirick Nieſon</hi>'s houſe, and a very large and ſerviceable <hi>Meeting</hi> it was: for both <hi>William Penn</hi> and <hi>I</hi> were drawn forth to open many things concerning the <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and to ſhew the benefit and ſervice of <hi>Yearly, Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly,</hi> and <hi>Monthly Meetings</hi> of <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Women.</hi> We had ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Meeting</hi> at <hi>Gertrude</hi>'s the <hi>next</hi> day, more publick, and very large, at which were <hi>Profeſſors</hi> of ſeveral ſorts, unto whom the Way of Life and Salvation was largely and livingly opened; which they hearkned very attentively to, none making any Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, to what was declared.

And if any have gone out, and backſlidden, and thrown off the <hi>Croſs,</hi> and are grown looſe and full, and are gone into <hi>Strife</hi> and <hi>Contention</hi> with their <hi>Earthly Spirits,</hi> and therein plead for a <hi>liberty;</hi> this <hi>Spirit</hi> taketh with looſe, earthly Spirits, and cries <hi>Impoſition</hi> to ſuch, as do admoniſh them to come to the <hi>Life, Light,</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> that they may be alive, and may live again with the Living. And then upon this <hi>Admoniſhment,</hi> their Spirits do ariſe into <hi>Contention</hi> and <hi>Strife,</hi> and a <hi>Separation,</hi> turning againſt the <hi>Living,</hi> in their looſe earthly Spirits, which would have the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> but is not in the <hi>Nature</hi> of it, but is for Eternal <hi>Judgment</hi> of the living Seed. And this is it, which doth deceive; but it is judged by that, which doth undeceive and ſave.</p>

            <p>This being the <hi>Firſt-day</hi> of the Week, we had a very large <hi>Meeting</hi> again, there coming to it a great Concourſe of People of ſeveral Opinions, as <hi>Baptiſts, Seekers, Socinians, Browniſts,</hi> and ſome of the <hi>Collegians. Robert Barclay, George Keith, Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Pen</hi> and <hi>I,</hi> did all ſeverally declare the Everlaſting <hi>Truth</hi> among them; opening the Eſtate of Man in the <hi>Fall,</hi> and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by what way Man and Woman may come into the <hi>Reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> by Chriſt Jeſus: And indeed, the <hi>Myſtery</hi> of <hi>Iniquity,</hi> and the <hi>Myſtery</hi> of <hi>Godlineſs</hi> were very plainly laid open; and the <hi>Meeting</hi> ended quietly and well.</p>
            <p>The day following, <hi>George Keith, Robert Barclay,</hi> and <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Penn,</hi> leaving me and ſome other <hi>Friends</hi> at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> ſet forward on their Journey towards <hi>Germany,</hi> where they Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled many <hi>hundred Miles,</hi> and had good Service for the Lord, <hi>Benjamin Furly</hi> going with them, and Interpreting.</p>
            <p>That day, and the next, I ſtayed at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> viſiting the Friends, and aſſiſting them in ſome buſineſſes concerning their <hi>Meetings:</hi> And there came <hi>Three Baptiſts</hi> to diſcourſe with me, unto whom I opened things to their ſatisfaction; and they part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from me in kindneſs. I writ a <hi>Letter</hi> alſo to the <hi>Princeſs Elizabeth,</hi> which <hi>Iſabel Yeomans</hi> delivered to her, when <hi>George Keith</hi>'s <hi>Wife</hi> and <hi>ſhe</hi> went to viſit her.</p>

                  <p>I Have heard of thy <hi>Tenderneſs</hi> towards the <hi>Lord</hi> and his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Truth,</hi> by ſome <hi>Friends,</hi> that have viſited thee, and alſo by ſome of thy <hi>Letters,</hi> which I have ſeen: which indeed is a great thing, for a <hi>Perſon</hi> of thy <hi>quality</hi> to have ſuch a <hi>tender mind</hi> after the <hi>Lord</hi> and his <hi>precious Truth;</hi> ſeeing, ſo many are ſwallowed up with <hi>Voluptuouſneſs,</hi> and the <hi>Pleaſures</hi> of this World, and yet all make an outward <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> one way or other; but without any deep Inward ſenſe and feeling of him.

And ſo now People are coming out of the <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> to the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Spirit,</hi> and to receive <hi>Faith</hi> from him, and not from men; and to receive the <hi>Goſpel</hi> from him, and their <hi>

<pb n="437" facs="tcp:51448:306"/> his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> which is <hi>Pure</hi> and <hi>Undefiled</hi> before God, and keeps from the Spots of the World: And to bring them out of all the Worlds <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Fellowſhips,</hi> that they have made and ſet up ſince the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> days; to the <hi>Church,</hi> that is in <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> of our <hi>Lord Jeſus Christ, Theſſ.</hi> 1.1. and to bring to the Unity and Fellowſhip in the holy <hi>Spirit,</hi> that doth mortifie, and circumciſe, and <hi>baptiſe,</hi> to plunge down <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> that has got up in Man and Woman by Tranſgreſſion: and in this <hi>holy Spirit</hi> there is a <hi>holy Fellowſhip</hi> and <hi>Unity:</hi> yea, it is the Bond of the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Princes,</hi> and <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Lords Peace:</hi> which heavenly <hi>Peace</hi> all the true <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> are to maintain with <hi>Spiritual Weapons,</hi> not with <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now my <hi>Friend,</hi> the holy Men of God did ſpeak forth the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> as they were moved by the <hi>holy Ghoſt;</hi> and all <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> are on heaps about thoſe <hi>Scriptures,</hi> becauſe they are not led by the ſame holy Ghoſt, as they were, that gave forth the <hi>Scriptures;</hi> which holy <hi>Ghoſt</hi> they muſt come to in themſelves, and be led by, if they come into <hi>All</hi> the <hi>Truth</hi> of them, and to have the Comfort of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Them.</hi> For none can call <hi>Jeſus Lord,</hi> but by the <hi>holy Ghoſt;</hi> and all they, that do call <hi>Chriſt Lord</hi> without the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> take his Name in vain. And likewiſe all that name his <hi>Name,</hi> are to depart from Iniquity; then they name his Name with Reverence in Truth and Righteouſneſs. And O therefore feel the <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> in thy heart, that is come by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which is a <hi>Teacher,</hi> that will <hi>teach</hi> thee, how to <hi>live,</hi> and what to <hi>deny;</hi> and it will eſtabliſh thy heart, and ſeaſon thy words, and bring thy Salvation, and will be a Teacher unto thee at all times; and by it thou may'ſt Receive <hi>Chriſt,</hi> from whence it comes: and as many as Receive him, to them he gives power, not only to ſtand againſt <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>evil,</hi> but to become the <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>God:</hi> if <hi>Sons,</hi> then <hi>Heirs</hi> of a <hi>Life,</hi> and a World and Kingdom, that is Everlaſting, without end, and of the Eternal Riches and Treaſures thereof. So in haſte, with my Love in the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that has taſted death for every man, and bruiſes the <hi>Serpents</hi> head, that has been betwixt Man and God, that through <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Man may come to God again, and ſo can praiſe God through <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Amen;</hi> who is the ſpiritual and heavenly <hi>Rock</hi> and <hi>Foundation</hi> for all God's People to build up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to the praiſe and glory of God, who is over all, bleſſed for Evermore.</p>

In the Afternoon <hi>John Claus</hi> and <hi>I</hi> walked through the City, to the place where the <hi>Wagon,</hi> which he had hired, was to meet us: and while we tarried for it, the <hi>Friends,</hi> that were in the City, came to the houſe, where we were, and there we had a little <hi>Meeting.</hi> When the Meeting was over, and the <hi>Wagon</hi> came not, we ſent to know the Reaſon: and the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> of the <hi>Wagon</hi> ſent us word, that he durſt not let his <hi>Wagon</hi> go; for the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Munſter</hi>'s <hi>Souldiers</hi> were up in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and he was afraid, they would take away his Horſes. So being diſappointed of our paſſage, we returned to <hi>John Claus</hi> his Father-in-law's houſe, where I left him, and went my ſelf to my <hi>Inn</hi> at night.</p>
            <p>We took <hi>Shipping</hi> next day, and paſſed about <hi>Fifteen Miles</hi> upon the <hi>River Eems,</hi> to a Market-Town in <hi>Eaſt-Friezland,</hi>

            <p>The People in the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Munſter's Country</hi> were very dark: and as we paſſed amongſt them, I preached <hi>Truth</hi> to them, warning them of the <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Notable Day</hi> of the <hi>Lord;</hi> and exhorting them to <hi>ſoberneſs,</hi> and to mind the <hi>good Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in themſelves.</p>

            <p>We got to <hi>Hamborough</hi> time enough to get a <hi>Meeting</hi> there that Evening; and a good and glorious <hi>Meeting</hi> it was.

               <note place="margin">The River <hi>Eyder.</hi> Frederick-ſtadt.</note> We went to a <hi>Friend</hi>'s houſe there, whoſe name is <hi>William Pauls,</hi> where ſeveral <hi>Friends</hi> came to us (for there is a pretty many <hi>Friends</hi> in that <hi>City</hi>) and we had a fine, refreſhing <hi>Meeting</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether that Evening; which made us forget our <hi>Wearineſs:</hi> for we were indeed very weary, having travelled hard thoſe <hi>Two days;</hi> and being Wet through our Cloaths, having had much <hi>Rain</hi> in our <hi>Open Wagons.</hi> But the Lord made all eaſie and good to us: and we were well, and glad to ſee <hi>Friends;</hi> bleſſed be his holy name for ever!</p>

            </p>
            <p>On the <hi>Firſt-day</hi> of the <hi>Week</hi> I had a <hi>Meeting</hi> here, to which many People came, and ſome <hi>rough Spirits:</hi> but the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> bound them down, and the <hi>Seed</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> was ſet over all. While I was here, I had a <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> with a <hi>Jew,</hi> that was a <hi>Levite,</hi> concerning the <hi>Coming</hi> of the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> and he was much confounded, in what he ſaid: Yet he carried himſelf lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly, and Invited me to his houſe: I went thither, and there I diſcourſed with another <hi>Jew,</hi> who ſhewed me their <hi>Talmud,</hi> and many other <hi>Jewiſh Books:</hi> but they are very <hi>dark,</hi> and do not underſtand their own <hi>Prophets.</hi>

            <pb n="442" facs="tcp:51448:309"/>
            <p>There was at this City a <hi>Baptiſt-Teacher,</hi> who had reproached and belied <hi>Friends:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1677.

            <p>Before we left this Place, I had another <hi>Meeting</hi> with the <hi>Friends</hi> only, wherein I laid before them the Uſefulneſs and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of a <hi>Monthly-Meeting,</hi> for the looking after the <hi>Poor,</hi> and taking care, that <hi>Marriages,</hi> and all other things relating to the <hi>Church,</hi> were done and performed in an <hi>orderly Manner:</hi> and the thing Anſwered the <hi>Witneſs</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in their <hi>Conſciences,</hi> ſo that they readily Conſented, and Agreed to have <hi>Monthly Meetings</hi> thence-forward amongſt themſelves, that both <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Women</hi> might look after, and take care of the outward <hi>Concerns</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this Meeting, feeling my ſpirit clear of that place, we took leave of <hi>Friends</hi> there (whom we left in good Order) and not intending to go further that way, we turned back again for <hi>Hamborough.</hi> When we had travelled <hi>one days Journey,</hi> and came to an <hi>Inn</hi> at night to Lodge, I inquired there, whether there were any <hi>tender People</hi> in the Town, that feared God, or that had a mind to diſcourſe of the things of God? but the <hi>Inn keeper</hi> told me, there were few ſuch in that Town. Next night we got to <hi>Hamborough;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hambo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough.</note> and having paſſed the <hi>Guards,</hi> we went to a <hi>Friend</hi>'s houſe, being very Weary: for we had been up thoſe <hi>Two Mornings</hi> before the <hi>third hour,</hi> and had travelled each day hard and late. Here we met with <hi>John Hill,</hi> an <hi>Engliſh Friend,</hi> who had been travelling in <hi>Germany;</hi> and being in a <hi>Ship</hi> bound for <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> that waited for a Wind, he had lain ſick on board her about <hi>two weeks;</hi> and now hearing, that I was in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, got off from the <hi>Ship,</hi> and came hither to meet me, and to go along with me.</p>
            <p>The next day after we came to <hi>Hamborough,</hi> we had a very good <hi>Meeting</hi> there, and very peaceable. After the Meeting I had <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> with a <hi>Swede,</hi> an Eminent man in his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; who having been <hi>baniſhed</hi> from thence upon the Account of his <hi>Religion,</hi> was come to <hi>Hamborough,</hi> and was at the <hi>Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> I had there before. And when I had done with him, I had another <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> wirh a <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> concerning the <hi>Sacraments</hi> (ſo called:) In both which I had good ſervice, having opportunity thereby to open <hi>Truth</hi> unto them.</p>
            <p>Being clear of <hi>Hamborough,</hi> we took our Leave of <hi>Friends</hi> there, whom we left well: And taking <hi>John Hill</hi> along with us, we paſſed by Boat to a <hi>City</hi> in the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lunenbergh</hi>'s <hi>Country;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lunen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burghs <hi>Country.</hi>
               </note> where after we were Examined by the <hi>Guards,</hi> we were had to the <hi>Main-Guard,</hi> and there Examined more ſtrictly: but after they found, that we were not <hi>Souldiers,</hi> they were Civil to us, and let us paſs. In the Afternnoon we travelled by <hi>Wagon,</hi> and the <hi>Waters</hi> being much out, by reaſon of the great <hi>Rains</hi> that had fallen, when it drew towards night, we hired a Boy upon the Way to guide us through a great <hi>Water,</hi> that we had
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:51448:309"/> to paſs. When we came to it, the <hi>Water</hi> was ſo deep,<note place="margin">1677. Lunen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burghs <hi>Country.</hi>
               </note> before we could come at the <hi>Bridge,</hi> that the <hi>Wagoner</hi> was fain to wade, and I drove the <hi>Wagon.</hi> But when we were come upon the <hi>Bridge,</hi> the Horſes brake part of it down, and one of them fell into the <hi>Water;</hi> the <hi>Wagon</hi> ſtanding upon that part of the <hi>Bridge,</hi> which remained unbroken: and it was the <hi>Lord</hi>'s mercy to us, that the <hi>Wagon</hi> did not run into the <hi>Brook.</hi> When they had got the <hi>Horſe</hi> out, he lay a while, as if he had been dead: but at length they got him up, and put him to the <hi>Wagon</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and laid the Planks right; and then (through the goodneſs of the Lord to us) we got ſafe over.</p>
            <p>After this we came to another <hi>Water,</hi> which finding to be very deep, and it being in the night, we hired <hi>Two Men</hi> to help us through. Theſe men put <hi>Cords</hi> to the <hi>Wagon,</hi> to hold it by, that the force of the <hi>Water</hi> might not drive it beſide the way. But when we came into it, the Stream was ſo ſtrong, that it took up one of the <hi>Horſes</hi> off his legs, and was carrying him down the Stream; which I ſeeing, called to the <hi>Wagoner,</hi> to pluck him to him by his Reins, which he did, and the <hi>Horſe</hi> recovered his Legs, and ſo with much difficulty we got over the <hi>Bridge,</hi> and went to <hi>Bormer-haven,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bormer-haven.</note> the Town where the <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goner</hi> lived. It was the <hi>laſt day</hi> of the <hi>ſixth Month,</hi> that we eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped theſe <hi>dangers;</hi> and it being about the <hi>eleventh hour</hi> in the night, when we came in here, we got ſome <hi>freſh ſtraw,</hi> and lay upon it, till about the <hi>fourth hour</hi> in the Morning: and then get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up, we ſet forward again towards <hi>Bremen,</hi> going part of the way by <hi>Wagon,</hi> and part by <hi>Boat.</hi> In the way I had good Opportunities to publiſh <hi>Truth</hi> among the <hi>People,</hi> eſpecially at a <hi>Market-Town,</hi> where we ſtay'd to Change our <hi>Paſſage;</hi> where I declared the <hi>Truth</hi> to the People, warning them of the <hi>Day</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> that was coming upon all Fleſh; and Exhorting them to Righteouſneſs, and telling them, <hi>that God was come to Teach his People himſelf,</hi> and that they ſhould turn to the <hi>Lord,</hi> and hearken to the <hi>Teachings</hi> of his <hi>Spirit</hi> in their own hearts.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Bremen</hi> we were Examined (as we uſually were in <hi>Cities</hi> and <hi>Garriſon-Towns</hi>) and after that we went to an <hi>Inn,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bremen.</note> and ſtay'd a while, till another <hi>Wagon</hi> was provided to carry us fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And here, though I felt the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Power</hi> was over the City, and kept the wicked and unruly Spirits down, yet my <hi>Spirit ſuffered</hi> much in this place, for the Peoples ſake. When our <hi>Wagon</hi> was ready, we left <hi>Bremen,</hi> and travelled through the <hi>Country</hi> to <hi>Keby,</hi> where we lodged at an <hi>Inn</hi> that night,<note place="margin">Keby.</note> and early next Morning ſet forth for <hi>Oldenburgh;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Olden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh.</note> which was a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable ſight, to ſee ſo great and brave a City <hi>burnt down.</hi> We went to an <hi>Inn,</hi> and though it was the <hi>Firſt-day</hi> of the <hi>Week,</hi> there were the <hi>Souldiers drinking,</hi> and <hi>playing</hi> at <hi>Shovel-board;</hi> and at thoſe few Houſes, that were left, the <hi>Shops</hi> were <hi>open,</hi> and the People <hi>Trading</hi> one with another. I was moved to ſpeak to the People, and declare the <hi>Truth</hi> among them, and warn them of the <hi>Judgments</hi> of <hi>God:</hi> And though they heard me quietly, and were civil towards me; yet I was <hi>burdened</hi> with

               <note place="margin">1677. <hi>Olden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh.</hi>
               </note> And many times in <hi>Mornings, Noons</hi> and <hi>Nights,</hi> at the <hi>Inns,</hi> and on the <hi>Ways,</hi> as I travelled, I ſpake to the <hi>People,</hi> preaching the <hi>Truth</hi> to them, and warning them of the <hi>Day</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and Exhorting them to turn to the <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in themſelves, that thereby they might be led out of <hi>Evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next day, paſſing through many great <hi>Waters,</hi> we came at night to <hi>Leer,</hi>

            <p>The day following we took ſhipping at <hi>Embden,</hi> and paſſed to <hi>Delfziel,</hi>

We Comforted and Encouraged him in the <hi>Lord,</hi> Exhorting him to be faithful, and ſtand ſtedfaſt in the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny committed to him. And when we had taken our Leave of him,<note place="margin">Groningen.</note> we took <hi>Boat,</hi> and paſſed the ſame day to <hi>Groningen,</hi> where we met with <hi>Cornelius Andries,</hi> a <hi>Friend,</hi> that had alſo ſuffered much by <hi>Impriſonment</hi> and <hi>Baniſhment</hi> at <hi>Embden.</hi> We went with him to his houſe; and the <hi>next day</hi> we had a good <hi>Meeting</hi> in that <hi>City,</hi> to which ſeveral <hi>Profeſſors</hi> came, and were very peaceable and attentive.

            </p>
            <p>Next day we paſſed away by <hi>Boat</hi> down the River to the <hi>Lake</hi> of <hi>Hempen-Sarmer,</hi>

            <p>We took <hi>Boat,</hi> and went back that Evening to <hi>Leuwarden,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Leuwarden</note> being 27 <hi>Miles:</hi> but before we could get thither, the <hi>Gates</hi> were ſhut, and the <hi>Bridges</hi> drawn up, ſo that we could not get into the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but were fain to lye in the <hi>Boat</hi> all night. And the next Morning, there having been a <hi>Man killed</hi> in the <hi>City</hi> that night, it was late, before the Gates were opened. When we could get in, we went to a <hi>Friend</hi>'s houſe, where we ſtay'd a while; and then, taking <hi>Boat</hi> again, we paſſed through <hi>Franeker</hi> to <hi>Harlingen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Franeker. Harlingen.</note> to <hi>Heſſel Jacobs,</hi> where we found ſeveral <hi>Dutch Friends,</hi> who were come to be at the <hi>Meeting</hi> there next day.

            </p>
            <p>In the Afternoon we had a <hi>publick Meeting,</hi> to which came People of ſeveral ſorts, as <hi>Socinians, Baptiſts, Lutherans,</hi> &amp;c. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which was a <hi>Doctor</hi> of <hi>Phyſick,</hi> and a <hi>Prieſt.</hi> And after I had declared the <hi>Truth</hi> a pretty large time to the <hi>People,</hi> open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto them the <hi>happy Eſtate,</hi> that Man and Woman were in, whilſt they kept under <hi>God's Teaching,</hi> and abode in the <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe</hi> of God; and on the other hand, the <hi>Wo</hi> and <hi>Miſery</hi> that came upon them, when they went from <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Teaching,</hi> and hearkning to the <hi>Serpent's Teaching,</hi> tranſgreſſed God's Command, and were driven out of the <hi>Paradiſe</hi> of <hi>God:</hi> And then came to ſet forth the <hi>Way,</hi> whereby Man and Woman might come into that <hi>happy Eſtate</hi> again. The <hi>Prieſt,</hi> an ancient, grave Man, ſtood up, juſt as I had done ſpeaking, and putting off his Hat, ſaid, <hi>I pray God to proſper and confirm that Doctrine, for it is Truth, and I have nothing againſt it.</hi> He would willingly have ſtay'd longer, until the <hi>Meeting</hi> had been ended; but being a <hi>Pariſh-Prieſt,</hi> and to preach that Evening, he could not ſtay longer, (the time for his own <hi>Worſhip</hi> being come:) Wherefore, when he had made <hi>Confeſſion</hi> to the <hi>Truth,</hi> he haſtned away, that he might come to the <hi>Meeting</hi> again; and did come, it ſeems to the <hi>Meeting-place,</hi> but the <hi>Meeting</hi> was ended <hi>firſt.</hi> After <hi>Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> we went to <hi>Heſſel Jacobs,</hi> where I had a <hi>Meeting</hi> with <hi>Friends;</hi> and the <hi>Doctor</hi> of <hi>Phyſick</hi> came thither to diſcourſe with <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Penn,</hi> who had a good opportunity to open <hi>Truth</hi> to him.

            <p>Early next Morning <hi>William Penn,</hi> taking <hi>John Claus</hi> with him, paſſed from <hi>Harlingen</hi> for <hi>Leuwarden,</hi> where he had appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a <hi>Meeting;</hi> intending, after that, to Travel into ſome other parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> to viſit a tender People there. <hi>I,</hi> with thoſe <hi>Friends</hi> that were with me,<note place="margin">Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</note> took Ship the ſame day for <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> where we arrived a little after <hi>Midnight;</hi> but the Gates being ſhut, we lay on Board till Morning: then went to <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude Dirick Nieſon</hi>'s, where many <hi>Friends</hi> came to ſee us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glad of our ſafe Return.

                  <p>TO whom is my Love in the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Truth,</hi> that is over all,<note place="margin">1677.

I am glad, that the <hi>Lord</hi> hath <hi>Witneſſes</hi> in that City, to ſtand for his <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Name,</hi> and to ſtand up for <hi>Christ Jeſus,</hi> the great <hi>Prophet,</hi> whom God hath raiſed up, who is to be heard in all things; ſo that ye need none of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> which men have raiſed up.

And they that are joined with them, it will be very hard for them ever to come down to <hi>Truth</hi> in themſelves, and to ſee their own Conditions, and to have that Spirit of <hi>Strife</hi> and <hi>Contention</hi> (which eateth as a Canker) to be brought down in them; which is carnal, and ſlayeth the tender <hi>Babe,</hi> which was once begotten in themſelves: and the <hi>Philiſtine</hi> is got up in them, that ſtoppeth the <hi>Wells</hi> and <hi>Springs,</hi> and maketh a great Buſle; and are crying up <hi>Men,</hi> and pleading for them inſtead of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                     <pb n="450" facs="tcp:51448:313"/> And ſo, <hi>Friends,</hi> ſtrive not with them; but let them take them, that cry them up: and keep you to the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> with his <hi>Light,</hi> that cometh from him; that he may be your <hi>Lord,</hi> and ye in him may be all in <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> in one <hi>Light, Life, Power</hi> and <hi>Dominion</hi> in Chriſt, your Head. And ſo the God of Peace and Power preſerve you all in <hi>Christ Jeſus,</hi> your Saviour; and out of and from that miſchievous <hi>Spirit,</hi> which is idle and ſlothful, as to the Work of the <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Light</hi> of God and Chriſt; and its very Act is that which worketh <hi>ſtrife</hi> and <hi>diſturbance</hi> againſt the Peace of the Church of Chriſt, and thinks in its wilfulneſs, and ſtubbornneſs, and unrulineſs to ſet up it ſelf, and in that to have peace: but <hi>Deſtruction</hi> will be the end of it; and it is ſealed for the <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Eternal Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> And therefore let Chriſt the <hi>Seed</hi> be the <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Crown</hi> of every one of you, that nothing may be between you, and the Lord God. And be not deceived with vain <hi>Words,</hi> or <hi>fained Words,</hi> or rough: for <hi>Satan</hi> is transforming himſelf, as an <hi>Angel</hi> of <hi>Light,</hi> to deceive; but God's Foundation ſtandeth ſure, and God knoweth, who are <hi>his,</hi> and will preſerve <hi>his</hi> upon the <hi>Rock</hi> and <hi>Foundation</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> in his peaceable Truth and Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; that in the ſame they may grow. And ſo keep out of <hi>Strife</hi> and <hi>Contention,</hi> with it, after that ye have born your <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony,</hi> in the Lord's Power and Truth, againſt it; and then keep in the <hi>Truth:</hi> for it hath a life in <hi>ſcribling, ſtrife</hi> and <hi>jang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> becauſe it would enlarge its <hi>Hell,</hi> and bring others into its Miſery, with the airy Power, and would get <hi>Power</hi> over the <hi>Good,</hi> and disjoin People from it; and ſo to make <hi>Rapes</hi> upon the <hi>Simplicity</hi> by its <hi>Subtilty.</hi> But I do believe, the <hi>Lord</hi> will defend his People, though he may try them, and exerciſe them with this <hi>Spirit</hi> for a time, as he hath done by it in days paſt, in other <hi>Veſſels</hi> it hath made uſe of, as it doth of theſe now; who have a more ſeeming <hi>fair Outſide,</hi> but foul, and rough, and <hi>rugged</hi> enough <hi>within,</hi> againſt the <hi>Seed, Chriſt,</hi> as ever were the <hi>Phariſees</hi> to deſtroy it: And they, under a pretence of <hi>Preaching Chriſt,</hi> are the men, that are the <hi>Deſtroyers</hi> and <hi>Crucifiers</hi> of him, and <hi>Killers</hi> of the <hi>Juſt</hi> not only in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but endeavouring with all their might to deſtroy it in others, where it is born; <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Herod,</hi> to <hi>ſlay</hi> the <hi>young Jews</hi> in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> as the <hi>Old</hi> did: I do feel it <hi>Worrying</hi> of them; and it is got up to be <hi>King,</hi> which knew not <hi>ſuffering Joſeph.</hi> But <hi>God</hi> will <hi>plague</hi> him; and the <hi>Seed</hi> will have more reſt, and be better entertained in <hi>Egypt,</hi> than under <hi>Herod,</hi> into whom Old <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Spirit is entred.

            <p>After I had given forth the fore-going <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> whereby my <hi>Spirit</hi> was in ſome meaſure eaſed of the <hi>Weight,</hi> that lay upon it; I went in the Afternoon to the <hi>Monthly Meeting</hi> of <hi>Friends</hi> at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> where the Lord was preſent with us, and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our Spirits together in himſelf.</p>
            <p>I thought to have gone next day to <hi>Harlem;</hi> but there being a <hi>Faſt</hi> appointed to be kept that day, I was ſtopped in my <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> and moved to ſtay at <hi>Friends Meeting</hi> that day at <hi>Amſterdam.</hi> We had a very large <hi>Meeting,</hi> a great Concourſe of People coming to it; and amongſt them many <hi>great Perſons.</hi> The <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Power</hi> was over the <hi>Meeting;</hi> and in the Openings thereof I was moved to declare to the People, <q>That no man by all his <hi>wit</hi> and <hi>ſtudy,</hi> nor by reading <hi>Hiſtory</hi> in his own Will, could declare or know the <hi>Generation</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> who was not begotten by the <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>Man,</hi> but by the <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> After I had largely o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened this unto them, I ſhewed them the <hi>Difference</hi> between the <hi>true Faſt,</hi> and the <hi>falſe;</hi> manifeſting unto them, that the profeſt <hi>Christians, Jews</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> were out of the <hi>true Faſt,</hi> and <hi>faſted</hi> for ſtrife and debate, being under the Band and Fiſts of <hi>Iniquity</hi> and <hi>Oppreſſion,</hi> wherewith they were ſmiting one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but the pure hands were not lifted up to God. And though they did all appear to men to <hi>Faſt,</hi> and did <hi>hang down their Heads for a day, like a Bulruſh,</hi> yet that was not the <hi>Faſt</hi> which God did accept: but in that ſtate all their <hi>Bones</hi> were <hi>dry;</hi> and when they called upon the <hi>Lord,</hi> he did not Anſwer them, neither did their <hi>Health</hi> grow: for they kept their own <hi>Faſt,</hi> and not the <hi>Lord</hi>'s. And there I exhorted them to come and keep the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Faſt,</hi> which was to <hi>faſt from Sin</hi> and <hi>Iniquity,</hi> from <hi>Strife</hi> and <hi>Debate,</hi> from <hi>Violence</hi> and <hi>Oppreſſion,</hi> and to abſtain from every <hi>Appearance</hi> of <hi>Evil.</hi>
               </q> Theſe things were opened to the aſtoniſhment of the <hi>Faſters;</hi> and the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ended peaceably and well.</p>
            <p>I went to <hi>Harlem</hi> the day following,<note place="margin">Harlem.</note> having before appointed a <hi>Meeting</hi> to be there that day. <hi>Peter Hendricks</hi> and <hi>Gertrude Dirick Nieſon</hi> went with me; and a bleſſed <hi>Meeting</hi> we had. There were at the Meeting <hi>Profeſſors</hi> of ſeveral ſorts, and a <hi>Prieſt</hi> of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> who ſate very Attentive for ſeveral hours, while I declared the <hi>Truth</hi> amongſt them; <hi>Gertrude</hi> Interpreting. When the <hi>Meeting</hi> was done, the <hi>Prieſt</hi> ſaid; <hi>That he had heard nothing, but what was according to the</hi> Word <hi>of</hi> God; and <hi>deſired, That the Bleſſing of the</hi> Lord <hi>might reſt upon us, and our Aſſemblies.</hi> Others alſo confeſſed to the <hi>Truth,</hi> ſaying; <hi>They had never heard things ſo plainly opened to their underſtandings before.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="452" facs="tcp:51448:314"/>
            <p>We ſtayed that night at <hi>Harlem</hi> at a <hi>Friend</hi>'s houſe, whoſe name was <hi>Dirick Klaſſen;</hi> and returning next day to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> went to <hi>Gertrude</hi>'s houſe: where we had not been long come in, before there came a <hi>Priest</hi> of great note, who had formerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the <hi>Emperor</hi> of <hi>Germany;</hi> and with him another <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Prieſt,</hi> deſiring to have ſome <hi>Conference</hi> with me. So I took the Opportunity to declare the <hi>Way</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> unto them; open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto them, how they might come to know <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Goſpel:</hi> and ſhewing them, that they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver know it by <hi>ſtudy,</hi> nor by <hi>Philoſophy;</hi> but by <hi>Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> through the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> opening unto them in the <hi>ſtilneſs</hi> of their <hi>Minds.</hi> The men were tender, and went away well ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>Firſt-day</hi> of the Week following, I was at <hi>Friends Meeting</hi> at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> where, amongſt the ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors,</hi> that were preſent, there was a <hi>Doctor</hi> of <hi>Poland,</hi> who for his <hi>Religion</hi> was <hi>baniſhed</hi> from the place, he lived in; and he being affected with the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> that was born in the <hi>Meeting,</hi> came after the <hi>Meeting,</hi> to have ſome <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> with me: and after we had been ſome time together, and I had opened things further to him; he went away very <hi>Tender</hi> and <hi>Loving.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now while I was at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> I ſpent moſt of my time (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it were, when I was at <hi>Friends Meetings,</hi> or when <hi>People</hi> came to ſpeak with me) in Writing <hi>Books, Papers,</hi> or <hi>Epiſtles</hi> on Truth's behalf. For I writ ſeveral <hi>Epiſtles</hi> from <hi>Amſterdam</hi> to <hi>Friends</hi> in <hi>England</hi> and elſewhere, on ſeveral Occaſions, as the <hi>Lord</hi> moved me by his <hi>Spirit</hi> thereunto. I writ alſo from thence <hi>A Warning to the Inhabitants of the City</hi> Oldenburgh, <hi>which was lately</hi> burnt down: Alſo <hi>A Warning to the Inhabitants of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of</hi> Hamborough. I writ alſo an <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Ambaſſadors,</hi> that were treating a <hi>Peace</hi> at <hi>Nimmeguen.</hi> To the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> and <hi>Prieſts</hi> of <hi>Embden</hi> I writ a <hi>Book,</hi> ſhewing them their <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Practices</hi> in <hi>perſecuting Friends.</hi> And ſeveral other <hi>Books</hi> I writ there, in <hi>Anſwer</hi> to <hi>Prieſts</hi> and others, of <hi>Hamborough, Dantzick,</hi> and other places, to Clear the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Friends</hi> from their falſe <hi>Charges</hi> and <hi>Slanders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After ſome time <hi>George Keith</hi> and <hi>William Penn</hi> came back from <hi>Germany</hi> to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and had a <hi>Diſpute</hi> with one <hi>Galenus Abrahams</hi> (one of the moſt noted <hi>Baptiſts</hi> in <hi>Holland</hi>) at which many <hi>Profeſſors</hi> were preſent: But not having time to finiſh the <hi>Diſpute</hi> then, they met again <hi>two days</hi> after; and the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> was much <hi>Confounded,</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> gained ground. Between theſe <hi>Two Diſputes</hi> we had a very great <hi>Meeting</hi> at <hi>Friends Meeting-Place,</hi> at which many <hi>hundreds</hi> of the <hi>World</hi>'s <hi>People</hi> were, and ſome of <hi>high Rank</hi> in the World's Account: for there was an <hi>Earl,</hi> and a <hi>Lord,</hi> and divers other Eminent Perſons, who all behaved themſelves very Civilly. But when the <hi>Meeting</hi> was ended, ſome <hi>Prieſts</hi> began to make ſome <hi>Oppoſition;</hi> which when <hi>William Penn</hi> underſtood, he ſtood up again, and anſwered them to the great ſatisfaction of the People; who were much affected with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:51448:314"/> 
               <hi>Teſtimonies,</hi> that they had heard declared. And after the <hi>Meeting</hi> ſeveral of them came to <hi>Gertrude</hi>'s, where we were, with whom <hi>George Keith</hi> had much Diſcourſe in <hi>Latin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having now finiſhed our Service at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> we took Leave of the <hi>Friends</hi> there, and paſſed by Wagon to <hi>Leyden,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Leyden.</note> which is about 25 <hi>Miles;</hi> where we ſtayed a <hi>day</hi> or <hi>two,</hi> ſeeking out and viſiting ſome <hi>tender People,</hi> that we heard of there. We met there with a <hi>German,</hi> who was partly <hi>Convinced;</hi> and he In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed us of an <hi>Eminent Man,</hi> that was inquiring after <hi>Truth.</hi> Some ſought him out, and viſited him, and found him a <hi>Serious Man;</hi> and I ſpake to him, and he owned the <hi>Truth. William Penn</hi> and <hi>Benjamin Furly</hi> went to viſit another <hi>Great Man,</hi> that lived a little out of <hi>Leyden,</hi> who, they ſaid, had been <hi>General</hi> to the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Denmark</hi>'s <hi>Forces;</hi> and he and his <hi>wife</hi> were very lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to them, and heard the <hi>Truth</hi> with <hi>Joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Leyden</hi> we went to the <hi>Hague,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hague.</note> where the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range</hi> then kept his <hi>Court;</hi> and we viſited one of the <hi>Judges</hi> of <hi>Holland,</hi> with whom we had pretty much Diſcourſe. He was a Wiſe, Tender man, and put many <hi>Objections</hi> and <hi>Queries</hi> to us; which when we had anſwered, he was ſatisfied, and parted with us in much Love. Then leaving the <hi>Hague,</hi> we went to <hi>Delft,</hi> and from thence that night to <hi>Rotterdam,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Delft. Rotterdam</note> where we ſtay'd ſeveral days, and had ſeveral <hi>Meetings</hi> there. While I was here, I gave forth a <hi>Book</hi> for the <hi>Jews:</hi> with whom, when I was at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> I had a deſire to have had ſome <hi>Diſcourſe;</hi> but they would not. Here alſo I reviewed ſeveral other <hi>Books</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,</hi> which I had given forth before, and were now <hi>Tranſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now finding our Spirits Clear of the <hi>Service,</hi> which the <hi>Lord</hi> had given us to do in <hi>Holland,</hi> we took Leave of: <hi>Friends</hi> of <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> and paſſed by Boat to the <hi>Briel,</hi> in order to take Paſſage that day in the <hi>Packet-Boat</hi> for <hi>England;</hi> ſeveral <hi>Friends</hi> of <hi>Rotterdam</hi> accompanying us, and ſome of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> who were come to ſee us again, before we left <hi>Holland.</hi> But the <hi>Packet-Boat</hi> not coming in till night, we were fain to lodge that night at the <hi>Briel:</hi> and next day, being the <hi>One</hi> and <hi>twentieth</hi> of the <hi>Eighth Month,</hi> and the <hi>Firſt-day</hi> of the <hi>Week,</hi> we went on Board, and ſet Sail about the <hi>Tenth</hi> hour, <hi>viz. William Penn, George Keith</hi> and <hi>I,</hi> and <hi>Gertrude Dirick Nieſon,</hi> with her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
            <p>We were in all about <hi>ſixty Paſſengers,</hi> and had a <hi>long</hi> and <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous Paſſage:</hi> for the Winds were contrary to us, and the Weather ſtormy; the <hi>Boat</hi> alſo <hi>very leaky,</hi> inſomuch, that we were fain to have <hi>two Plumps</hi> continually going both <hi>day</hi> and <hi>night;</hi> ſo that it was thought, there was <hi>twice</hi> as much <hi>Water</hi> plumped out, as the <hi>Veſſel</hi> would have held. But the <hi>Lord,</hi> who is able to make the <hi>ſtormy Winds</hi> to ceaſe, and the <hi>Raging Waves</hi> of the Sea to be calm, yea to raiſe them, and ſtop them at his pleaſure, he alone did preſerve us: praiſed be his Name for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver! Though our <hi>Paſſage</hi> was hard, yet we had a fine time, and good <hi>Service</hi> for <hi>Truth</hi> on Board among the <hi>Paſſengers,</hi> ſome

            <p>About this time I received Letters from <hi>New-England,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1677. London.</note> which gave account of the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> and <hi>Rulers cruel</hi> and <hi>unchriſtian-like Proceedings</hi> againſt <hi>Friends</hi> there, <hi>whipping</hi> and abuſing them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhamefully: for they <hi>whipped</hi> many <hi>Women-Friends;</hi> and one <hi>Woman</hi> they tied to a <hi>Cart,</hi> and dragged her along the Street, ſhe being <hi>ſtripped</hi> above the waſt. Yea, they <hi>whipped</hi> ſome <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> of <hi>Ships,</hi> that were not <hi>Friends,</hi> only for bringing <hi>Friends</hi> thither. And at that very time, while they were <hi>perſecuting Friends</hi> in this barbarous manner, the <hi>Indians</hi> ſlew <hi>threeſcore</hi> of their <hi>Men,</hi> and took one of their <hi>Captains,</hi> and <hi>fleyed the skin off of his head, while he was alive,</hi> and carried it away in <hi>Triumph:</hi> So that the <hi>ſober People</hi> ſaid; <hi>The Judgments of God came upon them for perſecuting the Quakers:</hi> but the blind, dark <hi>Prieſts</hi> ſaid; <hi>It was, becauſe they did not perſecute them enough.</hi> So a great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe I had in ſeeking <hi>Relief</hi> here for our poor <hi>ſuffering Friends</hi> there, that they might not lye under the <hi>Rod</hi> of the <hi>Wicked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this and other <hi>Services</hi> for <hi>Truth,</hi> to get <hi>Friends ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> in ſeveral places taken off, I ſtay'd in <hi>London</hi> a <hi>month</hi> or <hi>five weeks,</hi> viſiting <hi>Meetings,</hi> and helping and incouraging <hi>Friends</hi> to labour for the deliverance of their <hi>ſuffering Brethren</hi> in other parts. Afterwards I went down to <hi>Kingſton,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Kingſton</note> and viſited <hi>Friends</hi> there, and there-away. And having ſtay'd a little among <hi>Friends</hi> there, over looking a <hi>Book,</hi> which I had then <hi>ready</hi> to go to the <hi>Preſs;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bucks.</note> I went from thence croſs the Country into <hi>Buckingham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> viſiting <hi>Friends,</hi> and having ſeveral <hi>Meetings</hi> amongſt them; as at <hi>Amerſham, Hunger-hill, Jordans, Hedgerly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Amerſham. Hunger-hill. Jordans. Hedgerly. Wickham-Turvil-heath.</note> 
               <hi>Wickham</hi> and <hi>Turvil-heath:</hi> In ſome of which, they that were gone out from the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Friends in Truth, into <hi>Strife, Oppoſition</hi> and <hi>Diviſion,</hi> were very unruly and troubleſome. Particularly at the <hi>Mens-Meeting</hi> at <hi>Thomas Ellwood</hi>'s at <hi>Hunger-hill,</hi> where the Chief of them came from <hi>Wickham,</hi> endeavouring to make a diſturbance in the <hi>Meeting,</hi> and to hinder <hi>Friends</hi> from proceeding in the buſineſs of the <hi>Meeting.</hi> When I ſaw their deſign, I admoniſhed them to be ſober and quiet, and not trouble the <hi>Meeting,</hi> by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting the <hi>Service</hi> thereof; but rather, if they were diſſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with <hi>Friends Proceedings,</hi> and had any thing to Object, let a <hi>Meeting</hi> be Appointed on purpoſe ſome other day. So <hi>Friends</hi> offered them to give them a <hi>Meeting</hi> another day: and at length it was Agreed to be at <hi>Thomas Ellwood</hi>'s the week following.<note place="margin">Hunger-hill.</note> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly <hi>Friends</hi> met them there, and the <hi>Meeting</hi> was in the <hi>Barn</hi> (for there came ſo many, both of <hi>Friends,</hi> and of them, that the <hi>Houſe</hi> could not receive them:) So after we had ſate a while, they began their <hi>Jangling;</hi> and moſt of their <hi>Arrows</hi> were ſhot at <hi>me:</hi> but the <hi>Lord</hi> was with me, and gave me ſtrength in his Power to caſt back their <hi>Darts</hi> of <hi>Envy</hi> and <hi>Falſhood</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves. And ſo their <hi>Objections</hi> were <hi>Anſwered,</hi> and things were opened to the People; and a good Opportunity it was, and ſerviceable to the <hi>Truth:</hi> for many that before were weak, were now ſtrengthened and confirmed; and ſome that were doubting and wavering, were ſatisfied and ſettled; and the Faithful <hi>Friends</hi> were refreſhed and comforted in the ſpringings
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:51448:316"/> of <hi>Life</hi> amongſt us:<note place="margin">1677. Hunger-hill.</note> for the <hi>Power</hi> roſe, and <hi>Life</hi> ſprung, and in the ariſings thereof many living <hi>Testimonies</hi> were born againſt that <hi>wicked, dividing, rending Spirit,</hi> which thoſe <hi>Oppoſers</hi> were joined to, and acted by: And the <hi>Meeting</hi> ended to the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Friends. That night I lodged, with other <hi>Friends,</hi> at <hi>Thomas Ellwood</hi>'s; and the ſame week I had a <hi>Meeting</hi> again with thoſe <hi>Oppoſers</hi> at <hi>Wickham,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Wickham.</note> where they again ſhewed their <hi>Envy;</hi> and were made manifeſt to the Upright-hearted.</p>
            <p>Now after I had viſited <hi>Friends</hi> in that upper ſide of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamſhire,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Oxfordſhire.</hi> Henly. Cauſham.

After this <hi>Meeting</hi> I paſſed on through the Country, viſiting Friends, and having <hi>Meetings</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them in ſeveral places,<note place="margin">Barkſhire.

               </note> through <hi>Barkſhire</hi> and <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> and ſo on till I came to <hi>Briſtol;</hi> which was on the 24th day of the 11th Month, juſt before the <hi>Fair.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſtay'd at <hi>Briſtol</hi> all the time of the <hi>Fair,</hi> and ſome time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and many ſweet and precious <hi>Meetings</hi> we had there at that time; Many <hi>Friends</hi> being there from ſeveral parts of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſome on the account of <hi>Trade,</hi> and ſome in the <hi>Service</hi> of <hi>Truth.</hi> And great was the <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Unity</hi> of <hi>Friends,</hi> that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode faithful in the <hi>Truth;</hi> though ſome, who were gone out of the holy <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> and were run into <hi>Strife, Diviſion</hi> and <hi>Enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> were rude and abuſive to me, and behaved themſelves in a very Unchriſtian manner towards me. But the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Power</hi> was over all; by which being preſerved in the heavenly <hi>Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> which could bear <hi>Injuries</hi> for his Name's ſake, I felt do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion therein over the <hi>rough, rude</hi> and <hi>unruly Spirits:</hi> and would leave them to the <hi>Lord;</hi> who knew my <hi>Innocency,</hi> and would plead my <hi>Cauſe.</hi> And the more theſe laboured to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach</hi> and <hi>Vilifie</hi> me, the more did the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>Friends,</hi> that were ſincere and upright-hearted, <hi>Abound</hi> towards me; and ſome, that had been betrayed by the <hi>Adverſaries,</hi> ſeeing their <hi>Envy</hi> and <hi>rude behaviour,</hi> brake off from them: who have cauſe to bleſs the <hi>Lord</hi> for their <hi>deliverance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When I left <hi>Briſtol,</hi> I went with <hi>Richard Snead</hi> to a houſe of his in the <hi>Country,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Hezekiah Coale</hi>'s at <hi>Winter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn,</hi>

               <note place="margin">Sudbury.</note> Next day we paſſed to <hi>Sudbury,</hi> and had a large <hi>Meeting</hi> in the <hi>Meeting-houſe</hi> there; which at that time was of very good Service. We went <hi>next</hi> day to <hi>Natha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel

            <p>We went from <hi>Nailſworth</hi> on the <hi>First day</hi> of the <hi>Firſt Month</hi> 1677/8, and travelled through the Country, viſiting <hi>Friends,</hi> and having many <hi>Meetings</hi> amongſt them, at <hi>Cirenceſter, Crown-Allins,</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Parliament</hi> was ſitting, when I came to <hi>Town,</hi> and <hi>Friends</hi> having laid their <hi>Sufferings</hi> before them, were Waiting on them for Relief againſt the <hi>Laws</hi> made againſt <hi>Popiſh Recuſants,</hi> which they knew, we were not; though ſome malicious <hi>Magiſtrates</hi>

And alſo he Rebuked ſuch, that would have had</hi> fire to come down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to conſume <hi>ſuch, that would not receive Chriſt; and told them, That they did not know, what</hi> Spirit <hi>they were of; he came not to</hi> deſtroy mens lives, but to ſave them.</p>
                     <p>

And now none can ſay, that the</hi> World <hi>is</hi> end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: <hi>And therefore, how will all</hi> Chriſtendom <hi>anſwer the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and terrible</hi> God <hi>at his</hi> Day <hi>of</hi> Judgment, <hi>that have</hi> perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>one another about</hi> Religion before <hi>the</hi> end <hi>of the</hi> World, <hi>under a pretence of</hi> plucking up Tares; <hi>which is not their</hi> Work, <hi>but the</hi> Angels <hi>at the</hi> end <hi>of the</hi> World? <hi>And Chriſt Commands men to</hi> Love one another, <hi>and</hi> to Love Enemies; <hi>and by this they ſhould be known to be his Diſciples.

                     <p>Ennius <hi>ſaid;</hi> Wiſdom is driven out, when the Matter is acted by Force. And therefore the best of Men, and moſt glorious of Princes, were always ready to give Toleration.</p>
                     <p>Euſeb. <hi>in his Second Book of the</hi> Life <hi>of</hi> Conſtantine, <hi>reports theſe words of the Emperour:</hi> Let them, which err, with Joy receive the like fruition of Peace and Quietneſs with the Faithful; ſith the restoring of Communication and Society may bring them into the right Way of Truth: let none give Moleſtation to any; let every one do, as he determines in his Mind. And indeed, there is great reaſon for Princes to give Toleration to diſagreeing Perſons, whoſe Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions cannot by fair means be altered: for if the Perſons be Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, they will ſerve God according to their Perſwaſions; and if they be publickly prohibited, they will privately Convene: and then all thoſe Inconveniencies and Miſchiefs, which are Arguments againſt the permiſſion of Conventicles, are Arguments for the publick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions of differing Religions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they being reſtrained and made miſerable, endears the diſcontented Perſons mutually, and makes more hearty and dangerous Confederations.</p>
                     <p>The like Counſel <hi>in the</hi> Diviſions <hi>of Germany,</hi> at the firſt <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi> was thought reaſonable by the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and his excellent Son <hi>Maximilian;</hi> for they had obſerved, that Violence did exaſperate, was unblest, unſucceſsful and unreaſonable; and therefore they made Decrees of <hi>Toleration.</hi>

                        <hi>Alſo it is remarkable, that till the time of</hi> Juſtinian <hi>the</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, Anno Domini <hi>525.</hi> the <hi>Catholicks</hi> and <hi>Novatians</hi> had Churches indifferently permitted, even in <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>Paul</hi> preached the Kingdom of God, teaching thoſe things, which concerned the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, with all confidence; and no man forbad him: and this he did for the ſpace of two years in his own hired houſe at <hi>Rome,</hi> and received all that came to him.</p>
                     <p>NOW, O KING, <hi>ſeeing theſe Noble</hi> Teſtimonies <hi>concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Liberty <hi>of</hi> Conſcience <hi>of</hi> Kings, Emperours <hi>and others, and the</hi> Liberty, <hi>that</hi> Paul <hi>had at</hi> Rome <hi>in the days of the</hi> Heathen-Emperour, <hi>our deſire is, that we may have the ſame</hi> Liberty <hi>at</hi> Dantzick <hi>to</hi> Meet together <hi>in our own hired Houſes, which
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:51448:319"/> cannot be any prejudice, either to the</hi> King <hi>and the City of</hi> Dantzick, <hi>for us to meet together to</hi> wait upon the Lord, <hi>and pray unto him, and to ſerve and worſhip him in</hi> Spirit <hi>and</hi> Truth <hi>in our own hired Houſes; ſeeing our</hi> Principle <hi>leads us to hurt no Man, but to</hi> Love <hi>our</hi> Enemies, <hi>and to pray for them; yea, them that do</hi> perſecute <hi>us. And therefore, O</hi> King, <hi>Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the City of</hi> Dantzick, <hi>would you not think it hard for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to force you from your</hi> Religion <hi>to another, contrary to your</hi> Conſciences? <hi>And if it be ſo, that you would think it hard to you, then</hi> do you unto others, as you would have them do unto you; <hi>do not you that unto others, which you would not have men do unto you: for that is the</hi> Royal Law, <hi>which ought to be obeyed.

                     <p>WHO are Aſſembled together in the Name and Power of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Grace, Mercy</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> from God the Father, and from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt fill all your hearts, and eſtabliſh you in his <hi>Grace, Mercy</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> upon Chriſt, the holy living <hi>Rock</hi> and <hi>Foundation,</hi> who is the <hi>Firſt</hi> and <hi>Laſt,</hi> and over all the Foundations and Rocks in the whole world; a <hi>Rock</hi> and <hi>Foundation</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> for all the Living to build upon, which ſtands ſure in his heavenly, divine <hi>Light,</hi> which is the <hi>Life</hi> in him; by whom all things were made: who is the precious <hi>Stone</hi> laid in <hi>Sion</hi> (and not in the World) which all the Wiſe <hi>Maſter-Builders</hi> rejected, who pretended to build People up to Heaven with the <hi>Words</hi> of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and the <hi>Law</hi> from Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> but out of the Life of both: and therefore ſuch <hi>Builders</hi> could not receive the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> from <hi>Christ,</hi> the <hi>precious Stone</hi> laid in <hi>Sion,</hi> nor the Word from heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> But you, <hi>My Dear Friends,</hi> that have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this <hi>Law</hi> from heavenly <hi>Sion,</hi> and the <hi>Word</hi> from heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> where the <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Subſtance</hi> is enjoyed, you do ſee the end and aboliſhing of the <hi>Jews Law</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> from Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> And therefore my deſire is,
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:51448:325"/> that you all may keep in the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1679. Swarth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</note> which ye have in Chriſt Jeſus, by which <hi>Love</hi> the <hi>Body</hi> is edified, and knit and united together to Chriſt Jeſus, the <hi>Head.</hi> Which <hi>Love</hi> doth bear all things, and fulfils the <hi>Law;</hi> and will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve all in Humility, and in it to be of one mind, heart and ſoul: ſo that all may come to drink into that <hi>One Spirit,</hi> that doth Baptize them, and Circumciſe them; Plunging down, and Cutting off the Body of the <hi>Sins</hi> of the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> that is got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten up in Man and Woman by their tranſgreſſing of God's Commands. So that in this holy, pure Spirit all may <hi>ſerve</hi> and <hi>worſhip</hi> the pure God in <hi>Spirit</hi> and in <hi>Truth,</hi> which is over all the <hi>Worſhips,</hi> that are out of God's <hi>Spirit</hi> and his <hi>Truth.</hi> And in this <hi>Spirit</hi> ye will all have a Spiritual <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Fellowſhip,</hi> over all the Fellowſhips of the Unclean Spirits, which be out of <hi>Truth</hi> in the World. And ſo by this holy <hi>Spirit</hi> all your <hi>hearts, minds</hi> and <hi>ſouls</hi> may be knit together to Chriſt, from whence it comes; and by the <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> which is come by Jeſus Chriſt, which all ſhould be under the Teachings of in the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> and not under the <hi>Law,</hi> as the outward <hi>Jews</hi> were in the <hi>Old Covenant.</hi> So that by this <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> in the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> all may be made God's free Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to ſerve God in the new Life, and in the new and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Way; ſhewing forth the Fruits of the <hi>new heart</hi> and <hi>new ſpirit,</hi> in the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> over death and darkneſs, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was; Glory be unto the Lord for ever! And now <hi>Friends,</hi> in this <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> is your heavenly, gracious and true <hi>Liberty</hi> to every Spiritual Mind, that makes you free from him, that is out of <hi>Truth,</hi> where your <hi>bondage</hi> was. Alſo your <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> in the holy, divine and precious <hi>Faith,</hi> which gives you <hi>Victory</hi> over that, that hath ſeparated you from <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and through which <hi>Faith</hi> ye have Acceſs to God again, through Jeſus Chriſt. So in this divine and holy <hi>Faith,</hi> ye have divine, holy and precious <hi>Liberty,</hi> yea, and <hi>Victory</hi> over him that ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated you from God: and this <hi>Faith</hi> is held in a pure Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. So the <hi>Liberty</hi> in the Spirit of God is in that, which baptizes and plunges down <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Iniquity,</hi> and puts off the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Death,</hi> and <hi>Sins</hi> of the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> that is gotten up by tranſgreſſing of God's Command, as I ſaid before. And alſo the <hi>Liberty</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> which is ſent from Heaven by the Holy Ghoſt, which is the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which was and is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to be preached to all Nations; In this <hi>Goſpel</hi> (the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which is over the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Satan</hi>) is the true <hi>Liberty,</hi> and the Goſpel-Fellowſhip and Order. So that the <hi>Evil Spirit</hi> or Conſcience, or falſe, dead Faith, and that which is ungraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and out of Truth, and not in the Spirit of God, nor in his Goſpel, nor in the divine Faith, its <hi>Liberty</hi> is in the <hi>Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi> For all the true <hi>Liberty</hi> is in the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and in the <hi>Truth</hi> that makes free; and in the <hi>Faith,</hi> and in the <hi>Grace,</hi> and in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> who deſtroys the <hi>Devil</hi> and his Works, that hath brought all Mankind into <hi>Bondage.</hi> So in this heavenly peaceable <hi>Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> which works by Love,
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:51448:325"/> and in the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> and in Chriſt Jeſus is all the Saints Peace, and pure, true and holy <hi>Liberty;</hi> in which they have Salt, and Senſe, and Feeling, Diſcerning and Savour, yea, and Unity and Fellowſhip one with another, yea, and with the <hi>Son</hi> and the <hi>Father,</hi> that heavenly, eternal Fellowſhip. So all being ſubject to the <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> and to the <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Goſpel</hi> (the Power of God) and to his good <hi>Spirit,</hi> in this they diſtinguiſh all true, pure and holy <hi>Liberty</hi> from that which is <hi>falſe.</hi> And this will bring all to ſit low: for <hi>Patience</hi> runs the <hi>Race,</hi> and the <hi>Lamb</hi> muſt have the <hi>Victory;</hi> and not the rough, unruly and vain <hi>Talkers,</hi> unbaptized, uncircumciſed and unſanctified. For ſuch travel not in the way of <hi>Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> but in the way of <hi>unregeneration;</hi> Neither go they down into the <hi>Death</hi> with Chriſt by <hi>Baptiſm:</hi> and therefore ſuch are not like to <hi>Reign</hi> with him in his <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> who are not buried with him in <hi>Baptiſm.</hi> Therefore all muſt go down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, into the <hi>Death</hi> of Chriſt, and be crucified with him, if they will <hi>Ariſe,</hi> and follow him in the <hi>Regeneration,</hi> before they come to Reign with him. And <hi>Friends,</hi> Many may have precious <hi>Openings;</hi> but I deſire, all may be comprehended in that thing, which doth open to them. And that they may all keep in the daily <hi>Croſs;</hi> then they keep in the <hi>Power,</hi> that doth kill and crucifie that, which would lead them amongſt the <hi>Beaſts</hi> and <hi>Goats,</hi> to leaven them into their <hi>rough, unruly ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:</hi> But that through the <hi>Croſs,</hi> the Power of God, That may be crucified, and they in the <hi>Power</hi> might follow the <hi>Lamb.</hi> For the Power of God keeps all in <hi>Order,</hi> and in <hi>Subjection,</hi> and in <hi>Humility,</hi> in that which is <hi>lovely</hi> and <hi>vertuous, decent, comely, temperate</hi> and <hi>moderate;</hi> that their <hi>Moderation</hi> comes to appear to all men. So my deſire is, that all your <hi>Lights</hi> may <hi>ſhine,</hi> as from a City ſet upon a Hill, that cannot be hid; And that ye may be the <hi>Salt</hi> of the Earth, to ſalt and ſeaſon it, and make it ſavoury to God, and you all ſeaſoned with it. Then all your <hi>Sacrifices</hi> will be a <hi>ſweet ſavour</hi> to the Lord, and ye will be as the <hi>Lilies,</hi> and <hi>Roſes,</hi> and <hi>Garden</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which gives a <hi>ſweet ſmell</hi> unto him: Whoſe <hi>Garden</hi> is preſerved by his Power; that is the <hi>Hedge,</hi> that hedges out all the unruly and unſavoury, and the Deſtroyers and Hurters of the <hi>Vines, Buds</hi> and <hi>Plants,</hi> and God's tender <hi>Blade,</hi> which ſprings up from his <hi>Seed</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> who waters it with his heavenly <hi>Water,</hi> and <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> every moment, that they may grow and be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; that ſo he may have a pleaſant and fruitful <hi>Garden.</hi> And ſo here all are kept freſh and green, being watered every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the everlaſting, holy <hi>Water</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> from the Lord, the <hi>Fountain.</hi> So my dear <hi>Friends,</hi> my deſire is, that this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Seed,</hi> that bruiſes down the <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Serpent</hi> both within and without, may be all your <hi>Crowns</hi> and <hi>Lifes,</hi> and ye in him one another's <hi>Crown</hi> and <hi>Joy</hi> to the praiſe of the Lord God over all, bleſſed for evermore. This <hi>holy Seed</hi> will out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſt, and wear out all that, which the <hi>evil Seed</hi> ſince the Fall of Man, hath brought forth and ſet up. And as every one
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:51448:326"/> hath received Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, ſo walk in him in the <hi>Humility,</hi> which he teaches; and ſhun the occaſions of <hi>Strife,</hi> vain <hi>Janglings</hi> and <hi>Diſputings</hi> with Men of Corrupt Minds, who are deſtitute of the <hi>Truth:</hi> for the <hi>Truth</hi> is peaceable, and the <hi>Goſpel</hi> is a peaceable Habitation in the Power of God (which was before the <hi>Devil</hi> was) and his <hi>Wiſdom</hi> is peaceable and gentle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And his <hi>Kingdom</hi> ſtands in <hi>Peace. Oh!</hi> his Glory ſhines over all his Works! And in Chriſt Jeſus ye will have <hi>Peace,</hi> who is not of the World, yea, a <hi>Peace,</hi> that the World cannot take away: for the <hi>Peace,</hi> which ye have from him, was before the World was, and will be, when it is gone: So they are not like to take his <hi>Peace</hi> away from his <hi>People.</hi> This keeps all in that, which is <hi>weighty</hi> and <hi>ſubſtantial,</hi> over all <hi>Chaff;</hi> and will be, when it is gone: Glory to the Lord God over all for ever and ever, Amen!</p>
                     <p>And now, <hi>My dear Friends,</hi> the Lord doth require more of you, than he doth of other People; becauſe he hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted more to you. He requires <hi>Fruits</hi> of his <hi>Spirit,</hi> and of the <hi>Light,</hi> and of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and of the <hi>Grace,</hi> and of the <hi>Truth;</hi> for herein is he glorified (as Chriſt ſaid) in your <hi>bringing forth much Fruit:</hi> Fruits of <hi>Righteouſneſs, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>The World alſo does expect more from <hi>Friends,</hi> than from other People; becauſe you <hi>profeſs</hi> more. Therefore you ſhould be more <hi>Juſt,</hi> than Others, in your <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Dealings,</hi> and more <hi>Righteous, Holy</hi> and <hi>Pure</hi> in your Lives and Converſations; ſo that your <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Converſations</hi> may preach. For the Worlds <hi>Tongues</hi> and <hi>Mouths</hi> have preached long enough, but their <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Converſations</hi> have denied, what their <hi>Tongues</hi> have profeſſed and declared.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>Dear Friends,</hi> ſtrive to excel one another in <hi>Vertue,</hi> and that ye may grow in <hi>Love,</hi> that excellent Way, which unites all to Chriſt and God: And that all may ſtand up for <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Glory,</hi> and mind that which concerns the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Glory;</hi> that in no wiſe his <hi>Power</hi> may be abuſed, nor his <hi>Name</hi> evil ſpoken of by any evil <hi>Talkers</hi> or <hi>Walkers:</hi> but that in all things <hi>God</hi> may be honoured, and ye may glorifie him in your <hi>Bodies, Souls</hi> and <hi>Spirits,</hi> the little time ye have to live. So my Love to you all in the holy <hi>Seed</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> that reigns over all, and is the <hi>Firſt</hi> and <hi>Laſt;</hi> in whom ye all have <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Salvation,</hi> and your <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> with God, through Jeſus Chriſt, who deſtroys him that hath been betwixt you and God: ſo that nothing may be betwixt you and the Lord, but Chriſt Jeſus, Amen.</p>

A <hi>Day</hi> of <hi>Judgment</hi> will come, <hi>Vengeance</hi> and <hi>Recompence</hi> upon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one according to their <hi>Works.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples, who would have had <hi>Fire to come down from Heaven</hi> to conſume them, that would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him; He turned him about and rebuked them, and told them, <hi>They did not know, what ſpirit they were of;</hi> for he came not to deſtroy mens <hi>Lives,</hi> but to <hi>ſave</hi> them.</p>
                        <pb n="484" facs="tcp:51448:330"/>
                        <p>And therefore let all the <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> and the <hi>Priests</hi> in that which is called <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> conſider, who have deſtroyed Mens and Womens <hi>Lives</hi> ſince the Apoſtles days, becauſe they could not Receive their <hi>Religions, Ways</hi> and <hi>Worſhips,</hi> (or Conform to them) which they have made and ſet up; Have they known, what <hi>Spirit</hi> they have been of? Are they not all reproved by, and come under the <hi>Judgment</hi> of <hi>Chriſt?</hi> Therefore let all <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution</hi> be laid away concerning <hi>Religion,</hi> and let <hi>Love</hi> bear the ſway, to overcome <hi>Evil</hi> and <hi>Enemies;</hi> and let <hi>Patience</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ſway <hi>Paſſion</hi> in all ſuch doings: that all may retain the heavenly Reaſon, and the pure Underſtanding, that your <hi>Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> in true Chriſtianity may be known to all Men. For have you not the <hi>Turks, Jews, Tartars, Indians</hi> and <hi>Atheiſts Eyes</hi> upon you, and upon Chriſtendom? And therefore be in Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and let not the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> be blaſphemed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them by means of any, that bear the Name of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians:</hi> So that God may be glorified by all and in all, through Jeſus Chriſt, who is over all, who calls all to Peace, who is bleſſed for ever.</p>
                        <p>And now, I would have you to be as <hi>Noble,</hi> as the <hi>Bereans,</hi> and <hi>ſearch</hi> the <hi>Scriptures</hi> of Chriſt and the Apoſtles, where-ever he or they did give any Command to <hi>Impriſon, Baniſh, Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute</hi> or <hi>put to Death</hi> any, that would not receive or conform to them, or that were contrary-minded to them in <hi>Religion,</hi> or dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd from them in Matters of <hi>Worſhip?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Again, I deſire all Chriſtian <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> to ſearch both <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> and <hi>Chronicles,</hi> and ſee, what was the End of all <hi>Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors,</hi> and what <hi>Judgments</hi> came upon them. What came to <hi>Cain,</hi> who was the <hi>first Perſecutor</hi> for Matters of Faith and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice? Did not he become a <hi>Runnagade,</hi> a <hi>Vagabond</hi> and a <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitive</hi> in the Earth? What became of the <hi>Old World,</hi> that grieved God and <hi>Noah,</hi> a Preacher of Righteouſneſs? What be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of <hi>Sodom,</hi> that vex'd <hi>Juſt Lot?</hi> What became of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that <hi>perſecuted</hi> God's People in <hi>Egypt?</hi> (though the more he <hi>perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted</hi> them, the more they grew.) What became of <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Jezabel,</hi> that perſecuted the Lord's <hi>Prophets?</hi> And what became of <hi>Haman,</hi> that would have deſtroyed the <hi>Jews?</hi> What became of the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that <hi>perſecuted</hi> Chriſt and the Apoſtles? What was the End of all theſe? Are they not become <hi>Vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonds</hi> in the Earth, and driven away from their native <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try?</hi> Therefore I beſeech you in the Love and Fear of God, be ſo <hi>Noble</hi> as to <hi>ſearch</hi> both <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> and let not your divine underſtanding be clouded. What will become of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> and <hi>Whore,</hi> ſpoken of in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> with their <hi>falſe Prophets,</hi> that have drunk the <hi>blood</hi> of the <hi>Saints, Martyrs</hi> and <hi>Prophets</hi> of Jeſus? muſt they not all go with the <hi>Devil</hi> (who is a Murderer, Deſtroyer, an Enemy and Adverſary of Mankind) into the <hi>Lake</hi> of <hi>Fire,</hi> that burns with Brimſtone? And ye may be ſure, that <hi>Spirit</hi> that ſtirs you up to <hi>Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> let it be in whomſoever it will, is not of Chriſt, and of his Lamb-like Nature; who <hi>takes away</hi> the <hi>Sins</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> not the <hi>Lives</hi> of <hi>Men.</hi>

                           <hi>Paul</hi> was a <hi>Perſecutor,</hi> and a Haler to <hi>Priſon,</hi> before he was converted to Chriſtianity; but never after. And therefore, are not all in <hi>Saul</hi>'s nature (let them be of what Name or Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſoever they be) that are <hi>Perſecutors,</hi> and unconverted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Paul</hi>'s Life of Chriſtianity? He ſaid, the <hi>Life</hi> that he did live, after he was Converted, was by the <hi>Faith</hi> in the Son of God: And that He <hi>lived,</hi> yet not He, but <hi>Chriſt lived in him,</hi> who came to ſave mens <hi>Lives,</hi> and not to deſtroy them; Which <hi>Life</hi> ſhould be the <hi>Life</hi> of all Chriſtians now, which <hi>Paul</hi> in his converted ſtate lived in. And the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The</hi> Law <hi>is good, if a man uſe it</hi> lawfully; <hi>knowing this, that the</hi> Law <hi>is not made for a righteous man, but for the Lawleſs, and for the Ungodly and Sinners, and for Unholy and Prophane, and for Murtherers of Fathers and Mothers, and for Manſlayers, for Whoremongers, and for them that defile themſelves with Mankind, for Menſtealers, Liars and Perjured Perſons,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. So the <hi>Law</hi> in its place, is good againſt ſuch. Again the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>The Law was added, becauſe of Tranſgreſſion, Gal.</hi> 3.19. Now here all <hi>Magistrates</hi> may ſee, what the <hi>Law</hi> in its place is good againſt; and what it was made for and againſt; and what <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,</hi> the Apoſtle ſays, it takes hold upon: He does not ſay, the <hi>Law</hi> ſhould be laid upon Men, that differed from them in their <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Judgment,</hi> nor upon the <hi>Righteous men.</hi> And ſo you may ſee, in what condition the <hi>Law</hi> is good, and what it was made againſt; not againſt <hi>Righteous men,</hi> againſt whom they have nothing in their Lives and Converſations, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they differ from them in Matters of <hi>Religion;</hi> and let <hi>Manſlayers, Whoremongers, Perjured Perſons, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly, Prophane Perſons, Liars,</hi> &amp;c. go unpuniſhed: Such do not uſe, nor exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the <hi>Law lawfully,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſays; <hi>The</hi> Law <hi>is good, if a man uſe it</hi> lawfully. Therefore it ought to be uſed <hi>lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi> which <hi>Law</hi> the Apoſtle ſays, is for the puniſhment of the <hi>Evil-Doers,</hi> and a praiſe for them that do well: as may be ſeen, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. And ſo, as the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>We do not break the</hi> Law, <hi>nor make it void; but we eſtabliſh the</hi> Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.31.</p>

               <hi>Chamber:</hi> and with him I had a great deal of Diſcourſe concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Tithes.</hi> Whereupon he ſent for our <hi>Adverſary</hi>'s <hi>Atturney;</hi> and when he came, I offered him our <hi>Anſwer:</hi> He ſaid, If we would pay the <hi>Charges</hi> of the <hi>Court,</hi> and be bound to ſtand <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,</hi> and abide the <hi>Judgment</hi> of the <hi>Court,</hi> we ſhould not have the <hi>Oath</hi> tendred to us.

Wherefore leaving him, we went to one of the moſt noted <hi>Counſellors,</hi> and ſhewed him the <hi>ſtate</hi> of our <hi>Caſe,</hi> and our <hi>Anſwers:</hi> He was very Civil to us; and ſaid; <hi>This way of proceeding againſt us was ſomewhat like an</hi> Inquiſition. A few days after, thoſe <hi>Eight poor Friends,</hi> that were brought up ſo far out of the <hi>North,</hi> appeared before the <hi>Judges;</hi> and the <hi>Lord</hi> was with them, and his Power was over the <hi>Court,</hi> ſo that the <hi>Friends</hi> were not Committed to the <hi>Fleet.</hi> Our <hi>Cauſe</hi> was put off till the <hi>next Term</hi> (called <hi>Michaelmaſs Term</hi>) and then it was brought before the <hi>Four Judges</hi> again. Then <hi>William Mead</hi> told the <hi>Judges,</hi> that I had engaged my ſelf never to meddle with my <hi>Wife</hi>'s <hi>Eſtate:</hi> The <hi>Judges</hi> could hardly believe, that any Man would do ſo: Whereupon he ſhewed them the <hi>Writing</hi> under my <hi>Hand</hi> and <hi>Seal;</hi> at which they wondred. Then <hi>Two</hi> of the <hi>Judges,</hi> and ſome of the <hi>Lawyers</hi> ſtood up, and <hi>pleaded</hi> for me, that I was not liable to the <hi>Tithes:</hi> But the other two <hi>Judges,</hi> and divers other <hi>Lawyers</hi> preſſed earneſtly, to have me <hi>ſequeſtred;</hi> alledging, that I was a <hi>publick Man.</hi> At length they prevailed with one of the other <hi>Two Judges</hi> to <hi>Join</hi> with them; and then they granted a <hi>Sequeſtration</hi> againſt <hi>me</hi> and my <hi>Wife</hi> together. Thereupon, by Advice of <hi>Counſel</hi> we moved for a <hi>Limitation,</hi> which was granted; and that much defeated our <hi>Adverſary</hi>'s <hi>deſign</hi> in ſuing out the <hi>Sequeſtration:</hi> for this limited the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> from taking no more, than was proved. One of the <hi>Judges,</hi> who was called <hi>Baron Weſton,</hi> was very <hi>bitter</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me; and brake forth in a great <hi>Rage</hi> againſt me in the open <hi>Court:</hi> but in a little time after he <hi>died.</hi>

            <p>Now had I ſome Inclination to have gone into the <hi>Country</hi> to a <hi>Meeting:</hi> But hearing, that there would be a <hi>Buſsle</hi> at our <hi>Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> and feeling a great <hi>diſquietneſs</hi> in Peoples <hi>ſpirits</hi> in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty about <hi>Chooſing Sheriffs;</hi> it was upon me to ſtay in the City, and go to the <hi>Meeting</hi> in <hi>Gracious-ſtreet</hi> upon the <hi>Firſt-day</hi> of the <hi>Week.

This <hi>Goſpel,</hi> I declared, was ſent from Heaven by the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> days, and is ſo now; and was not of <hi>man,</hi> neither by <hi>man;</hi> but by the <hi>Revelation</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And now this <hi>Goſpel</hi> is preached again, (as <hi>John</hi> ſaw, and ſaid it ſhould be) to all <hi>Nations, Tongues</hi> and <hi>Peoples;</hi> and all <hi>People</hi> now are to <hi>hear Chriſt</hi> the <hi>Prophet,</hi> in this his <hi>Goſpel</hi> of the <hi>New Covenant.</hi> For as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid, <hi>Like unto me will God raiſe up a Prophet, and him ſhall ye hear in all things:</hi> ſo, ſaid I, this <hi>Prophet Chriſt,</hi> is come, and all the <hi>Jews in ſpirit,</hi> the true believing <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in the <hi>Light,</hi> who have the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God</hi> written in their hearts, and put into their <hi>minds,</hi> are to <hi>hear Chriſt</hi> in his <hi>Goſpel, New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament</hi> and <hi>New Covenant,</hi> which is the Law of the Spirit of
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:51448:335"/> Life in Chriſt Jeſus, who bruiſes the <hi>Serpent</hi>'s head (which is the <hi>head</hi> of <hi>Enmity</hi>) and makes free from the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Death.</hi> And I ſhewed, that all whom Chriſt quickens and makes alive, he makes them to ſit together in the <hi>heavenly places</hi> in himſelf. So that they do not wander up and down, like the <hi>Fool</hi>'s <hi>eye</hi> in the <hi>Corners</hi> of the <hi>Earth;</hi> nor are their <hi>Eyes</hi> abroad in the <hi>World,</hi> to ſit down in the <hi>World's</hi> invented Seats of <hi>Religion;</hi> but they ſit together in him, as the <hi>Saints</hi> did in the Apoſtles days: and ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> was and is their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of <hi>Wiſdom, Life, Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Salvation.</hi>
               </q> Now as I was thus ſpeaking, <hi>two Conſtables</hi> came in with their great <hi>Staves,</hi> and bid me <hi>give over ſpeaking, and come down:</hi> But I, feeling the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> with me, ſpake on therein, both to the <hi>Conſtables,</hi> and to the <hi>People.</hi> To the <hi>Conſtables</hi> I declared, <q>That we were a <hi>peaceable People,</hi> who meet to <hi>wait</hi> upon <hi>God,</hi> and worſhip him in <hi>Spirit</hi> and in <hi>Truth;</hi> and therefore (I told them) they needed not to come with their <hi>Staves</hi> amongſt us, who were met in a <hi>peaceable</hi> manner, deſiring and ſeeking the <hi>good</hi> and <hi>ſalvation</hi> of all People.</q> Then turning my Speech to the People again, I declared what further was upon me to them: and while I was ſpeaking, the <hi>Conſtables</hi> drew out towards the door; and the <hi>Souldiers</hi> ſtood with their <hi>Muskets</hi> in the Yard. When I had done ſpeaking, I kneeled down, and <hi>prayed,</hi> deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Lord to open the <hi>Eyes</hi> and <hi>Hearts</hi> of all People, both high and low, that their minds might be turned to God by his <hi>holy Spirit;</hi> that he might be glorified in all and over all. After <hi>prayer</hi> the <hi>Meeting</hi> roſe, and <hi>Friends</hi> paſſed away; the <hi>Conſtables</hi> being come in again, but without the <hi>Souldiers:</hi> and indeed, both <hi>they</hi> and the <hi>Souldiers</hi> carried themſelves <hi>Civilly. William Penn</hi> and <hi>I</hi> went into a <hi>Room</hi> hard by, as we uſed to do, and many <hi>Friends</hi> went with us; and leſt the <hi>Conſtables</hi> ſhould think, we would ſhun them; a <hi>Friend</hi> went down and told them, That, if they would have any thing with us, they might come where we were, if they pleaſed. <hi>One</hi> of them came to us ſoon after, but without his <hi>Staff;</hi> which he choſe to do, that he might not be obſerved: for he ſaid, <hi>The People told him, he buſied himſelf more than he needed.</hi> We deſired to ſee his <hi>Warrant;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we found, that the <hi>Informer</hi> was one <hi>Hilton,</hi> a <hi>North-Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> who was reputed to be a <hi>Papist.</hi> The <hi>Conſtable</hi> was ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; <hi>Whether</hi> he would Arreſt us by his <hi>Warrant</hi> on that day? (it being the <hi>Firſt-day</hi> of the <hi>Week,</hi> which in their <hi>Law</hi> was called the <hi>Lord's-day</hi>) and he ſaid, <hi>He thought he could not:</hi> He told us alſo, <hi>That he had charged the</hi> Informer <hi>to come along with him to the Meeting; but he had run away from him.</hi> We ſhewed the <hi>Conſtable,</hi> that both <hi>he</hi> and <hi>we</hi> were Clear; yet to free him from all <hi>fear</hi> of <hi>danger,</hi> we were free to go to the <hi>Alderman,</hi> that grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Warrant.</hi> Then a <hi>Friend,</hi> that was preſent, ſaid; He would go with the <hi>Conſtable</hi> to ſpeak with the <hi>Alderman:</hi> which they did, and came preſently back again; the <hi>Alderman</hi> being gone from home: We ſeeing the <hi>Constable</hi> in a ſtrait, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to be a <hi>tender Man,</hi> bid him, <hi>ſet</hi> an <hi>hour</hi> to come to
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:51448:335"/> us again, or ſend for us, and we would come to him. So he appointed the <hi>fifth hour</hi> in the <hi>Afternoon;</hi> but neither <hi>came,</hi> nor <hi>ſent</hi> for us: and a <hi>Friend</hi> meeting him afterwards in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the <hi>Conſtable</hi> told him, <hi>He thought, it would come to nothi g, and therefore did not look after us.</hi> So the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Power</hi> was over all, to him be the Glory!</p>
            <p>On the <hi>Fourth day</hi> following, it was upon me to go to <hi>Gracious-ſtreet-Meeting</hi> again: for I had heard, that they would come, to <hi>break up</hi> the <hi>Meeting</hi> that day. The <hi>Neighbours,</hi> it ſeems, were Informed ſo; and a <hi>Juſtice</hi> had granted a <hi>Warrant</hi> for that purpoſe: and the <hi>Conſtable</hi> told a <hi>Friend,</hi> that <hi>Hilton</hi> the <hi>Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> had been with him about it. The <hi>Conſtable</hi> would have had the <hi>Informer</hi> to have gone with him to the <hi>Meeting,</hi> but the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former</hi> would not; but would have the <hi>Conſtable</hi> go without him: Whether that put the <hi>Conſtable</hi> by from coming, I know not; but he did not come. I was in a <hi>Travel</hi> of <hi>Spirit</hi> in the power of God, and was moved in it to go to the <hi>Meeting;</hi> and the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Power</hi> did chain all down: And though they threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to bring the <hi>Red-Coats,</hi> yet none came, nor was there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſturbance; but a glorious, powerful <hi>Meeting</hi> it was, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry peaceable: Glory and Honour and Praiſes be to the <hi>Lord</hi> over all for ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>During the time I thus abode at <hi>London,</hi> as I had leiſure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Meetings,</hi> and from other <hi>Publick Services,</hi> I writ divers <hi>Books</hi> and <hi>Papers;</hi> ſome of which were <hi>printed,</hi> and others were ſpread about in <hi>Manuſcript.</hi> Of theſe, <hi>One</hi> was directed <q>

               <note place="margin">London.</note> where our <hi>Meetings</hi> were for the moſt part <hi>disturbed</hi> and <hi>broken up,</hi> or <hi>Friends</hi> were forced to <hi>Meet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Doors,</hi> being kept out of their <hi>Meeting-Houſes</hi> by the <hi>Officers.</hi> Yet ſometimes, beyond expectation, we got a quiet and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Meeting</hi> in the <hi>Houſes.</hi> One time I was minded to have gone <hi>a mile</hi> or <hi>two</hi> out of <hi>Town,</hi> to viſit a <hi>Friend,</hi> that was not well: But hearing, that the <hi>King</hi> had ſent to the <hi>Mayor</hi> to put the <hi>Laws</hi> in Execution againſt <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> and that the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates</hi> thereupon intended to <hi>Nail up the Meeting-houſe-doors,</hi> I had not freedom to go out of <hi>Town;</hi> but was moved to go to the <hi>Meeting</hi> at <hi>Gracious-ſtreet.</hi> And notwithſtanding all the <hi>Threats,</hi> a great <hi>Meeting</hi> it was, and very quiet; and the <hi>Glory</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> ſhone over all.</p>

               <note place="margin">1682. London.</note> 
               <hi>and did not know, that there was a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there.</hi> They would have perſwaded him, that he muſt needs know of it; but he ſtanding ſtedfaſt in the <hi>denial</hi> of it, they ſaid; <hi>They ſhould take order, to have it look'd after in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon.</hi> But a multitude of <hi>Buſineſs</hi> coming before them at the <hi>Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions;</hi> when <hi>Dinner-time</hi> came, they haſted to their <hi>Dinner,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving <hi>order:</hi> And when they came to the <hi>Bench</hi> again after <hi>Dinner,</hi> the Lord put it out of their Minds, ſo that they ſent no <hi>Officer;</hi> and ſo the <hi>Meeting</hi> was quiet, beginning and ending in peace; and a bleſſed <hi>Meeting</hi> we had, the Lord's Preſence being preciouſly amongſt us.

            <p>I had ſeen the <hi>Mayor</hi>'s <hi>printed Speech</hi> for putting the <hi>Laws</hi> in Execution againſt <hi>Diſſenters:</hi> and it was much in my mind, that we ſhould draw up a <hi>Paper</hi> to ſend to the <hi>Mayor</hi> and <hi>Aldermen,</hi> to clear our ſelves from being ſuch, as thoſe <hi>Laws</hi> were made againſt; and to ſet forth our <hi>peaceable Behaviour</hi> both towards the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Government.</hi> Accordingly a <hi>Paper</hi> was drawn up, and ſigned, and delivered to the <hi>Mayor;</hi> and <hi>Copies</hi> thereof to the <hi>Aldermen,</hi> and to the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>London</hi> alſo: And they generally took it kindly, and were <hi>Civil</hi> to the <hi>Friends,</hi> that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered it.</p>

And when the <hi>Meeting</hi> was done, and <hi>Friends</hi> began to paſs away, the <hi>Constable</hi> put off his Hat, and <hi>deſired the Lord to bleſs</hi> us: for the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> was over him and the People, and kept them under.</p>
            <p>After this I went up and down, viſiting <hi>Friends</hi> at their <hi>hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> who had had their <hi>Goods taken</hi> from them for worſhipping God; and we took an account, of what had been taken from them: and ſome <hi>Friends</hi> met together about it, and drew up
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:51448:339"/> the <hi>Caſe</hi> of the <hi>Sufferings</hi> of our <hi>Friends</hi> in writing, and gave it to the <hi>Juſtices</hi> at their <hi>Petty-Seſſions.</hi> Whereupon they made an <hi>Order, That the Officers ſhould not ſell the Goods of Friends, which they had in their hands, but keep them until the next Seſſions:</hi> which gave ſome diſcouragement to the <hi>Informers,</hi> and put a little ſtop to their proceedings.</p>
            <p>The next <hi>Firſt-day</hi> it was upon me to go to the <hi>Meeting</hi> at the <hi>Savoy:</hi> and by that time the <hi>Meeting</hi> was gathered,<note place="margin">Savoy Meet.</note> the <hi>Beadle</hi> came in; and after him came in the <hi>wild People,</hi> like a <hi>Sea:</hi> but the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Power</hi> chained them all. The <hi>Spirit</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> went through and over all, and they were quiet, and we had a glorious, peaceable Meeting; bleſſed be the Lord for his unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able goodneſs. This was in the <hi>Twelfth Month</hi> 1682.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Firſt Month</hi> 1683. I went to <hi>Kingſton</hi> upon <hi>Thames:</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1683"/> and it being then a time of <hi>Perſecution,</hi> as I went to the <hi>Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> I met the <hi>Chief Conſtable,</hi> who had been at the <hi>Meeting-Place,</hi>

            <p>Having viſited and encouraged <hi>Friends</hi> there, I returned to <hi>London,</hi> and went to the <hi>Meeting</hi> at <hi>Bull</hi> and <hi>Mouth,</hi>

                  <hi>Heaven</hi> is God's Throne, and <hi>Earth</hi> is his Footſtool: and will ye not let us <hi>stand</hi> upon <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Footstool</hi> to worſhip, and ſerve the living God?</q> While I ſpake, they were quiet: and after I had cleared my ſelf, of what was upon me to ſpeak, we brake up our <hi>Meeting</hi> in <hi>peace.</hi> This was on the <hi>Sixth-day</hi> of the <hi>Week.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the <hi>Firſt-day</hi> of the <hi>Week</hi> following I was moved to go to the <hi>Meeting</hi> at <hi>Gracious-street:</hi> and when I came there,<note place="margin">Grac.

            <p>The <hi>next</hi> day I went down to <hi>Guilford</hi> in <hi>Surrey:</hi>

This is and was the <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And now the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Hope</hi> fill you with all <hi>joy</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> in believing, that ye may abound in <hi>hope,</hi> through the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>holy Ghoſt.</hi> And I my ſelf alſo am perſwaded of you, my <hi>Brethren,</hi> that ye alſo are full of <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> filled with all <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and are able alſo to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh one another, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.13, 14. Here the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in which <hi>Chriſt</hi> was in the midſt, a <hi>Teacher</hi> and the <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> they were and are able through him to <hi>admoniſh</hi> one another. And let the <hi>peace</hi> of <hi>God</hi> rule in your hearts; to which <hi>Peace</hi> of <hi>God</hi> ye are alſo called into <hi>one Body</hi> (to wit, of <hi>Christ.</hi>) And let the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> dwell in you richly in all <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> teaching and admoniſhing one another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Col. 3. <hi>And whatſoever ye do, in Word or Deed, do all in the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.</hi> And above all things put on <hi>Charity,</hi> which is the <hi>Bond</hi> of <hi>Perfectneſs.</hi> And the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith to <hi>Timothy, Be not thou aſhamed of the Teſtimony of our Lord, nor of me his Priſoner: but be thou Partaker of the Afflictions of the Goſpel, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Power of God, who hath ſaved us, and called us with an holy Calling; not according to our works, but according to his own purpoſe and grace, which was given us in Chriſt Jeſus, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world began,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.8, 9. So here it concerns every one, not to be <hi>aſhamed</hi> of the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of our <hi>Lord,</hi> who hath
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:51448:342"/> called them by his <hi>Grace;</hi> and not to be aſhamed of any of <hi>Christ's Priſoners,</hi> and afflicted Ones for Chriſt's and his Goſpels ſake, who aboliſhes <hi>Death,</hi> and brings <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Immortality</hi> to Light through his Goſpel: You that believe in the <hi>Light,</hi> know it. And <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith in his <hi>General Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt; As every man</hi> (mark, every man) <hi>hath received the Gift, ſo miniſter the ſame one to another, as good Stewards of the manifold Grace of God. If any man ſpeak, let him ſpeak, as the Oracles of</hi> God (ſo not of <hi>Men:) If any man miniſter, let him do it as of the Ability, which God gives</hi> (ſo not of the <hi>Ability</hi> of <hi>mens Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences) that God in all things may be glorified through Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. For theſe <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> come from <hi>Jeſus</hi> into the hearts of the <hi>Members</hi> of his <hi>Church,</hi> whom he is in the midſt of. And if any man <hi>ſuffer,</hi> as a <hi>Christian,</hi> let him not be <hi>aſhamed;</hi> but let him glorifie God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And every true <hi>Chriſtian</hi> hath the <hi>preſence</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> (who hath all power in Heaven and in Earth given him) to ſupport them with his <hi>power, light</hi> and <hi>life.</hi> And Chriſt ſaith to his Believers, <hi>Beware of men, for they will deliver you up to the Councils, and they will ſcourge you in the Synagogues, and you ſhall be brought before Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours and Kings for my Names ſake, for a Teſtimony againſt them and the Gentiles. But when they deliver you up, take no thought, how or what ye ſhall ſpeak; for it ſhall be given you in the ſame hour, what ye ſhall ſpeak: for it is not you that ſpeak; but the Spirit of your Father, that ſpeaketh in you. And ye ſhall be hated of all men for my Names ſake: but he that endureth to the end, ſhall be ſaved. The Diſciple is not above his Maſter, nor the Servant above his Lord: It is enough for the Diſciple, that he be as his Maſter, and the Servant as his Lord: for if they have called the Maſter of the houſe</hi> Beelzebub, <hi>what will they do to his Servant. Fear not them, which kill the Body, but are not able to kill the Soul,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>A Sparrow ſhall not fall to the ground with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out your heavenly Father,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The hairs of your head are all num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred; ye are of more value, than many Sparrows. Whoſoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall confeſs me before men, him will I confeſs alſo before my Father, which is in heaven: But whoſoever ſhall deny me before Men, him will I alſo deny before my Father, which is in heaven. And whoſoever ſhall be aſhamed of me and of my words, of him ſhall the Son of Man be aſhamed, &amp;c.</hi> Matth. 10. And again Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall be aſhamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and ſinful Generation, of him alſo ſhall the Son of Man be aſhamed, when he comes in the Glory of his Father with his holy Angels,</hi> Mark 8.38. And Chriſt ſaith to his Diſciples, <hi>He that receiveth you, receiveth me; and he that receiveth me, receiveth him that ſent me: He that receiveth a Prophet in the name of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, ſhall receive a Prophet's reward: And he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man, ſhall receive a righteous man's reward. And whoſoever ſhall give to drink unto one of theſe little ones a Cup of cold water only, in the name of a Diſciple, verily I ſay unto you, he ſhall in no wiſe loſe his reward.</hi> Matth. 10.40, 41, 42. Here ye may ſee, how Chriſt encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:51448:342"/> his Diſciples, and them that receive them. And <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>Among the chief Rulers of the</hi> Jews <hi>many believed in Chriſt; but becauſe of the</hi> Phariſees, <hi>they did not confeſs him, leſt they ſhould be put out of the Synagogue,</hi> John 12.42. Too many ſuch <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers</hi> are now a-days, who dare not <hi>Confeſs Christ,</hi> leſt they ſhould loſe the <hi>favour</hi> of <hi>men.</hi> But Chriſt encourages the <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Diſciples,</hi> and told them, They would put them out of their <hi>Synagogues;</hi> yea, that the time ſhould come, that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>killed</hi> them, would think, they did <hi>God ſervice: And theſe things,</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>will they do unto you, becauſe they have not known the Father, nor me. But theſe things have I told you, that when the time ſhall come, ye may remember, that I told you of them,</hi> John 16.2, 3, 4. Here ye may ſee, what <hi>Chriſt</hi> told his <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> ſhould come to paſs to them. And <hi>Saul,</hi> before he was <hi>Converted,</hi> did Compel the Chriſtians to <hi>blaſpheme,</hi> and made havock of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Acts 8. and chap. 22. and 26. And did not the <hi>Beaſt</hi> (in the <hi>Revelations) Compel</hi> both ſmall and great to <hi>worſhip</hi> him and his Image? And did not all <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> it, but they, who had their <hi>Names</hi> written in the <hi>Lamb</hi>'s <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> before the Foundation of the World? And did not <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> ſet up an <hi>Image ſixty Cubits</hi> high, and <hi>ſix Cubits</hi> broad? And then did not he cauſe an <hi>Herauld</hi> to cry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud, <hi>It is commanded, that all People, and Nations, and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages fall down, and worſhip the golden Image, that</hi> Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar <hi>hath ſet up: And whoſo falleth not down, and worſhippeth, ſhall the ſame hour be caſt into the midſt of the fiery Furnace?</hi> And were not <hi>Shadrach, Meſhach</hi> and <hi>Abednego</hi> caſt into the <hi>Furnace?</hi> Dan. 3. But God delivered them. Therefore it is good, to be <hi>faithful</hi> to God and his Worſhip in Spirit and Truth. And the <hi>Jews</hi> had agreed, that if any man ſhould <hi>Confeſs Chriſt,</hi> he ſhould be put out of their <hi>Synagogue,</hi> John 9.22. So it was for <hi>Christ</hi>'s ſake, they were <hi>Excommunicated</hi> out of their <hi>Synagogues.</hi> But as it is written, <hi>Behold, I lay in</hi> Sion <hi>a Stumbling-ſtone, and a Rock of Offence; and who ſo believes on him, ſhall not be aſhamed.</hi> So Chriſt is a <hi>Stumbling-ſtone,</hi> and a <hi>Rock</hi> of <hi>Offence</hi> to all the Unbelievers in the <hi>Light,</hi> which is the <hi>Life</hi> in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whether they be <hi>Jews, Chriſtians,</hi> or <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> did believe, a <hi>Chriſt</hi> was <hi>To come,</hi> from the <hi>Scriptures:</hi> And the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> believe, <hi>He is come,</hi> by the <hi>Scriptures;</hi> but do not believe in the <hi>Light</hi> (which is the <hi>Life</hi> in <hi>Chriſt</hi>) as Chriſt commands; and ſo do not become the <hi>Children</hi> of the <hi>Light.</hi> Therefore ye, that are the <hi>Believers</hi> in the <hi>Light,</hi> and are become the <hi>Children</hi> of the <hi>Light,</hi> walk in Chriſt your <hi>Way, Life</hi> and <hi>Salvation.</hi>

                     <p>MY Love is to you all in the <hi>holy Seed,</hi> that reigns over all.

            <p>Having viſited <hi>Friends</hi> at and about <hi>Kingston,</hi>
               <note place="margin">London</note> I returned to <hi>London:</hi> for it being a Suffering time with <hi>Friends</hi> there, I had not freedom to be long from the City. Being come back, I went to the <hi>Meeting</hi> at the <hi>Peel;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Peel-Meet.</note> which but a little before the <hi>Juſtices</hi> and <hi>Conſtable</hi> had broken up, and had carried themſelves very roughly: But that day the <hi>Meeting</hi> was in the <hi>Houſe,</hi> and quiet; and a glorious Meeting it was, bleſſed be the Lord.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>Firſt-day</hi> following I went to the <hi>Meeting</hi> at <hi>Gracious-ſtreet.</hi> When I came there,<note place="margin">Grac-Meet.</note> I found three <hi>Conſtables</hi> in the <hi>Meeting-houſe,</hi> who kept <hi>Friends</hi> out; ſo that we met in the <hi>Court.</hi> After I had been ſome time in the <hi>Meeting,</hi> I ſtood up, and ſpake to the People; and continued ſpeaking a pretty while.

            <p>I continued yet at <hi>London,</hi> labouring in the <hi>Work</hi> and <hi>Service</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> both in <hi>Meetings</hi> and out; ſometimes viſiting the <hi>Friends</hi> that were in <hi>Priſon</hi> for the Teſtimony of Jeſus, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging them in their <hi>Sufferings,</hi> and exhorting them to ſtand <hi>faithful</hi> and <hi>ſtedfaſt</hi> in the Teſtimony, which the Lord had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them to bear: ſometimes alſo viſiting thoſe that were <hi>ſick</hi> and <hi>weak</hi> in <hi>Body,</hi> or <hi>troubled</hi> in <hi>Mind,</hi> helping to bear their Spirits up from ſinking under their Infirmities. Sometimes our <hi>Meetings</hi> were quiet and peaceable; ſometimes they were diſturbed and broken up by the <hi>Officers.</hi> One <hi>Firſt-day</hi> it was upon me to go to the <hi>Meeting</hi> at the <hi>Savoy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sav.

<pb n="514" facs="tcp:51448:345"/> that by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> they might know <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whom God hath ſent; whom to <hi>know</hi> was <hi>Eternal Life.</hi> And that by the <hi>Spirit</hi> they might all come into <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and know him to be their <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> who deſtroys the <hi>Devil,</hi> the <hi>Destroyer,</hi> and his <hi>works;</hi> and bruiſes the <hi>Serpent</hi>'s head. For Chriſt was a <hi>Sanctuary</hi> to them, to whom he was a <hi>Saviour,</hi> whom he ſaved from the <hi>Deſtroyer.</hi> And Chriſt did <hi>baptize</hi> them with the holy <hi>Ghoſt,</hi> and with <hi>Fire,</hi> and did thorowly purge his <hi>floor,</hi> and burn up their <hi>Chaff</hi> with unquenchable fire, that is, <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Corruption,</hi> which is got into Man and Woman by their <hi>Tranſgreſſion:</hi> But Chriſt gathereth his <hi>Wheat</hi> into his <hi>Garner.</hi> So all that are <hi>baptized</hi> with <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> their <hi>Wheat</hi> is in <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Garner:</hi> and no Spoiler can get into <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Garner</hi> to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with the <hi>Wheat</hi> there; though they may be permitted to meddle with the outward <hi>Goods,</hi> &amp;c.</q> Now as I was ſpeaking in the power of the Lord, and the People were greatly affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therewith; on a ſudden the <hi>Conſtables,</hi> with the <hi>rude People,</hi> came in like a <hi>Sea:</hi> and one of the <hi>Conſtables</hi> ſaid to me, <hi>Come down;</hi> and he laid hands on me. I asked him, <hi>Art thou a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian? We are Chriſtians.</hi> He had hold on my <hi>hand,</hi> and was very <hi>fierce</hi> to <hi>pluck me down:</hi> but I ſtood ſtill, and ſpake a few words to the People; deſiring of the <hi>Lord,</hi> that the <hi>Bleſſings</hi> of <hi>God</hi> might reſt upon them all. The <hi>Conſtable</hi> ſtill called upon me to <hi>Come down,</hi> and at length <hi>pluckt</hi> me <hi>down;</hi> and bid another <hi>Man</hi> with a <hi>Staff, Take</hi> me, <hi>and carry me to Priſon.</hi> That <hi>Man</hi> had me to another <hi>Officer</hi>'s houſe, who was more <hi>Civil:</hi> and after a while they brought in <hi>Four Friends</hi> more, whom they had taken. I was very <hi>Weary,</hi> and in a great <hi>Sweat;</hi> and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Friends,</hi> hearing where I was, came to me in the <hi>Conſtable</hi>'s houſe: but I bid them all go their ways, leſt the <hi>Conſtables</hi> and <hi>Informers</hi> ſhould ſtop them. After a while the <hi>Conſtables</hi> had us almoſt <hi>a Mile</hi> to a <hi>Juſtice,</hi> who was a <hi>fierce, paſſionate Man:</hi> who, after he had asked me my <hi>Name,</hi> and his <hi>Clerk</hi> had taken it down in writing, upon the <hi>Conſtable</hi>'s informing him, <hi>That I preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Meeting,</hi> ſaid in an angry manner; <hi>Do not you know, that it is contrary to the</hi> King<hi>'s Laws to preach in ſuch Conventicles, contrary to the Liturgy of the Church of</hi> England? There was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent one — <hi>Shad,</hi> (a wicked <hi>Informer,</hi> who was ſaid to have <hi>broken Gaol</hi> at <hi>Coventry,</hi> and to have been <hi>burnt in the hand</hi> at <hi>London</hi>) who hearing the <hi>Juſtice</hi> ſpeak ſo to me, ſtept up to him, and told him; <hi>That he had Convicted them on the Act of the</hi> 22d <hi>of King</hi> Charles <hi>the Second. What! You Convict them?</hi> ſaid the <hi>Juſtice; Yes,</hi> ſaid <hi>Shad, I have Convicted them; and you muſt Convict them too upon that Act.</hi> With that the <hi>Justice</hi> was <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry</hi> with him, and ſaid; <hi>You Teach me! What are you? I'le Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict them of a Riot.</hi> The <hi>Informer</hi> hearing that, and ſeeing the <hi>Juſtice Angry,</hi> went away in a <hi>Fret;</hi> and ſo he was diſappointed of his purpoſe. I thought he would have <hi>ſworn</hi> ſome body againſt me; whereupon I ſaid, <q>Let no man <hi>ſwear</hi> againſt me; for it is my Principle <hi>Not to ſwear:</hi> and therefore I would not have any man <hi>Swear</hi> againſt me.</q> The <hi>Juſtice</hi> thereupon
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:51448:345"/> asked me; <hi>If I did not preach in the Meeting?</hi> I told him, <q>I did Confeſs, what <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> had done for my <hi>Soul;</hi> and did praiſe God: and I thought, I might have done that in the <hi>Streets,</hi> and in <hi>all Places,</hi> viz. <hi>Praiſe God,</hi> and <hi>Confeſs, Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> and this I was not aſhamed to <hi>Confeſs.</hi> Neither was this contrary to the <hi>Liturgy</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
               </q> The <hi>Juſtice</hi> ſaid; <hi>The Laws were againſt ſuch Meetings, as were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Liturgy of the Church of</hi> England. I ſaid; <q>I knew no ſuch <hi>Laws</hi> againſt our <hi>Meetings:</hi> but if he did mean that <hi>Act,</hi> that was made againſt ſuch, as did <hi>Meet to Plot and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive, and raiſe Inſurrections againſt the</hi> King, we were no ſuch People; but did abhor all ſuch Actions: and did bear true <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Good-will</hi> to the <hi>King,</hi> and to all Men upon the Earth.</q> The <hi>Juſtice</hi> then asked me; <hi>If I had been in Orders?</hi> I told him, No. Then he took his <hi>Law-books,</hi> and ſearched for <hi>Laws</hi> againſt us; bidding his <hi>Clerk,</hi> take the <hi>Names</hi> of the <hi>reſt</hi> the mean time: But when he could find no other <hi>Law</hi> againſt us, the <hi>Clerk ſware</hi> the <hi>Conſtable</hi> againſt us. Some of the <hi>Friends</hi> bid the <hi>Conſtable, Take heed what he ſwore, leſt he were perjured: for he took them in the Entry, and not in the Meeting.</hi> Yet the <hi>Conſtable,</hi> being an <hi>Ill Man, ſwore, That they were in the Meeting.</hi> However the <hi>Juſtice</hi> ſaid; <hi>Seeing there was but one Witneſs, he would diſcharge the reſt; but he would ſend me to</hi> Newgate, <hi>and I might preach there,</hi> he ſaid. I asked him, <q>If it ſtood with his Conſcience, to ſend me to <hi>Newgate</hi> for <hi>praiſing God,</hi> and for <hi>Confeſſing Chriſt Jeſus?</hi>
               </q> He cried, <hi>Conſcience! Conſcience!</hi> but I felt, my words <hi>toucht</hi> his <hi>Conſcience.</hi> He bid the <hi>Conſtable, Take me away;</hi> and <hi>he would make a</hi> Mittimus <hi>to ſend me to Priſon, when he had dined.</hi> I told him, <q>I deſired his peace, and the <hi>good</hi> of his <hi>Family;</hi> and that they might be kept in the <hi>fear</hi> of the <hi>Lord:</hi>
               </q> So I paſſed away. And as we went, the <hi>Conſtable</hi> took ſome <hi>Friends word,</hi> that I ſhould come to his houſe the <hi>next Morning</hi> by the '<hi>eighth hour.</hi> Accordingly I did go, with thoſe <hi>Friends:</hi> and then the <hi>Conſtable</hi> told us, That he went to the <hi>Juſtice</hi> for the <hi>Mittimus,</hi> after he had <hi>dined;</hi> and the <hi>Juſtice</hi> bid him, <hi>Come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain after the Evening-Service:</hi> which he did; and then the <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice</hi> told him, <hi>He might let me go.</hi> So, ſaid the <hi>Constable,</hi> you are <hi>diſcharged.</hi> I blamed the <hi>Conſtable</hi> for turning <hi>Informer,</hi> and <hi>ſwearing</hi> againſt us; and he ſaid, <hi>He would do ſo no more.</hi> Next day the <hi>Juſtice</hi> meeting with <hi>Gilbert Laty,</hi> asked him, <hi>If he would pay Twenty pounds for</hi> George Fox<hi>'s Fine?</hi> He ſaid, <hi>No. Then,</hi> ſaid the <hi>Juſtice, I am diſappointed:</hi> for being but a <hi>Lodger,</hi> I cannot come by his <hi>Fine;</hi> and he having been brought before me, <hi>and being of ability himſelf, I cannot lay his</hi> Fine <hi>on any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After I was <hi>diſcharged,</hi> I went up into the <hi>City.</hi> And the <hi>ſame Week</hi> the <hi>Seſſions</hi> coming on, where many <hi>Friends</hi> were concerned, ſome as <hi>Priſoners,</hi> and ſome on <hi>Trials</hi> of <hi>Appeals</hi> upon the <hi>Conventicle-Act,</hi> I went to a <hi>Friend's houſe</hi> not far off, that I might be in readineſs to Aſſiſt thoſe <hi>Friends</hi> with <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,</hi> or otherwiſe, as occaſion ſhould offer: and I found <hi>Service</hi>

               <hi>Read this in your Aſſemblies amongſt the Faithful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I tarried yet a little while in <hi>London,</hi> viſiting <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Meetings,</hi> and labouring in the <hi>Work</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> there. And being on a <hi>Firſt-day</hi> at the <hi>Bull</hi> and <hi>Mouth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bull <hi>and</hi> M. Meeting.</note> where the <hi>Meeting</hi> had long been kept out; but was that day in the Houſe, peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and large: the People were ſo affected with the <hi>Truth,</hi> and refreſhed with the powerful Preſence of the <hi>Lord,</hi> that when the <hi>Meeting</hi> was ended, they were loth to go away.</p>
            <p>After ſome time, having ſeveral things upon me to write, I went to <hi>Kingſton,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Kingſton.</note> that I might be free from Interruptions. And when I came there, I underſtood, the <hi>Officers</hi> had been very Rude at the <hi>Meeting</hi> there, <hi>nipping</hi> and <hi>abuſing Friends,</hi> and had driven them out of the <hi>Meeting-Place;</hi> and very abuſive they continued to be for ſome time. Among other things that I writ, whilſt I was there, one was a little Book (printed ſoon after) the Title whereof was; <hi>The Saints heavenly and ſpiritual Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity and Communion,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>wherein is ſet forth, what the true Goſpel-worſhip is, and in what the true <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity and Communion of the Saints ſtands; with a diſcovery of thoſe, that were gone from this holy Unity and Communion, and were turned againſt the Saints, that abode therein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When I had finiſhed the <hi>Services,</hi> for which I went thither, and had viſited the <hi>Friends</hi> there, I returned to <hi>London;</hi> and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited moſt of the <hi>Meetings</hi> in and about the City.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eſſex.</hi> Dolſton.</note> Afterwards I went to viſit a <hi>Friend</hi> in <hi>Eſſex;</hi> and returning by <hi>Dolſton,</hi> I made
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:51448:347"/> ſome ſtay at the <hi>Widow Stots,</hi> and there I writ an <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to <hi>Friends,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1683. Dolſton.</note> declaring the <hi>Word</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> unto them: which <hi>Epiſtle</hi> being then <hi>printed,</hi> may be read amongſt my other printed Books.</p>
            <p>I came from <hi>Dolſton</hi> to <hi>London,</hi>
               <note place="margin">London.</note> and the next day was ſent for in haſte to my Son <hi>Rouſe</hi>'s at <hi>Kingston;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Kingſton.</note> whoſe daughter <hi>Marga<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ret</hi> lay very ſick, and had a deſire to ſee me. I tarried now at <hi>Kingſton</hi> about a week, and then returned to <hi>London;</hi>
               <note place="margin">London.</note> where I continued for the moſt part of the <hi>Winter,</hi> and the <hi>Spring</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, until the <hi>General Meeting</hi> in the Year 1684. (ſave that I went once as far as <hi>Enfield,</hi> to viſit <hi>Friends</hi> thereabouts.) And in this time I ceaſed not to labour in the <hi>Work</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> being frequent at <hi>Meetings,</hi> and viſiting <hi>Friends,</hi> that were <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners,</hi> or that were <hi>ſick;</hi> and in writing <hi>Books</hi> for the ſpreading of <hi>Truth,</hi> and opening the Underſtandings of People to receive it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Yearly-Meeting</hi> was in the <hi>Third Month,</hi> and a bleſſed, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1684"/> weighty <hi>Meeting</hi> it was; wherein <hi>Friends</hi> were ſweetly refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together: for the Lord was with us,<note place="margin">Yearly Meeting.</note> and opened his heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Treaſures amongſt us. And though it was a time of great difficulty and danger, by reaſon of <hi>Informers</hi> and <hi>perſecuting Magiſtrates;</hi> yet the <hi>Lord</hi> was a Defence and Place of Safety to his People.</p>
            <p>Now had I drawings in Spirit to go into <hi>Holland,</hi> to viſit the Seed of God in thoſe <hi>Provinces.</hi> And as ſoon as the <hi>Yearly Meeting</hi> was over, and moſt of the <hi>Country-Friends</hi> gone out of Town; I prepared for my <hi>Journey.</hi> There went with me from <hi>London Alexander Parker, George Watts</hi> and <hi>Nathaniel Braſſey,</hi> who alſo had drawings into that Country. We took Coach on the 31th of the Third Month 84. and got to <hi>Colcheſter</hi> that night.<note place="margin">Colcheſter.</note> The next day, being the <hi>Firſt-day</hi> of the <hi>Week,</hi> we went to the <hi>Meeting</hi> there: and though there was no notice given of my coming thither, yet our being there was preſently ſpread over the <hi>Town,</hi> and in ſeveral places in the <hi>Country,</hi> at <hi>ſeven</hi> and <hi>ten Miles</hi> diſtance; ſo that abundance of <hi>Friends</hi> came in <hi>double-horſed,</hi> which made the <hi>Meeting</hi> very <hi>Large.</hi> I had a Concern and Travel in my mind, leſt this <hi>great Gathering</hi> ſhould have ſtirred up the Town, and been more than the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> could well bear; but it was very quiet and peaceable, and a glorious <hi>Meeting</hi> we had, to the ſettling and ſtabliſhing of <hi>Friends</hi> both in <hi>Town</hi> and <hi>Country:</hi> for the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Power</hi> was over all; bleſſed be his Name for ever. Truly, the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Preſence</hi> was beyond words; for I was but <hi>Weak</hi> to go into a <hi>Meeting,</hi> and my <hi>Face</hi> (by reaſon of a <hi>Cold</hi> I had taken) was <hi>ſore:</hi> but God was ſtrong, and manifeſted his ſtrength in us and with us, and all was well: the <hi>Lord</hi> have the Glory for evermore for his ſupporting <hi>Power.</hi> After the <hi>Meeting</hi> there came, I think, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove an <hi>hundred Friends</hi> of the <hi>Town</hi> and <hi>Country</hi> to ſee me at <hi>John Furley</hi>'s; and very glad we were to ſee one another, and greatly refreſhed we were together, being filled with the <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Riches</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> bleſſed be his Name for ever!</p>

               </q> This ſeem'd to give him great ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

                     <p>I Underſtand, that formerly by ſome <hi>Evil-minded perſons</hi> it was reported to thee, when one <hi>Elizabeth Hendricks</hi> came to <hi>Fredrickſtadt</hi> to viſit the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> there in thy <hi>Country, That it was a Scandal to the Chriſtian Religion, that a</hi>

                     <p>And whereas 'tis ſaid; <hi>Women muſt ask their Husbands at home,</hi> &amp;c.

For, as the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle</hi> ſaith, <hi>They that believe, are entred into their reſt, and have ceaſed from their own works, as God did from his.</hi> Now this <hi>Reſt</hi> is an Eternal <hi>Rest</hi> in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Eternal <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> in whom every true <hi>Believer</hi> hath everlaſting <hi>Life</hi> in Chriſt Jeſus, their <hi>Reſt</hi> and everlaſting <hi>Day.</hi> For <hi>Chriſt</hi> the <hi>Reſt</hi> bruiſeth the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent</hi>'s <hi>head,</hi> and through <hi>Death</hi> deſtroyeth <hi>Death,</hi> and the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> (the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>Death</hi>) and his works: And he is the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Reſt,</hi> that giveth eternal <hi>Life</hi> to his Sheep. And Chriſt ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filleth the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and all the <hi>Figures, Shadows</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> as in the <hi>Old Testament;</hi> and all the <hi>Promiſes</hi> are <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> their and our <hi>Eternal Reſt,</hi> who was the <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Reſt</hi> to all the true <hi>Believers</hi> in the <hi>Apoſtles days,</hi> and ever ſince; and is ſo now.

                        <p>And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.9, 10.) <hi>In like manner alſo, that Women adorn themſelves in modeſt Apparel, with ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facedneſs and ſobriety: not with broidered Hair, or Gold, or Pearls, or coſtly Array; but (which becometh Women profeſſing Godlineſs) with good Works.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now here ye may ſee, what the <hi>Women</hi> were not to <hi>Adorn</hi> themſelves with, who profeſſed Godlineſs: They were not to adorn themſelves with <hi>broidered Hair,</hi> nor <hi>Gold,</hi> nor <hi>Pearls,</hi> nor <hi>coſtly Array;</hi> for this was not looked upon to be <hi>modeſt Apparel</hi> for <hi>holy Women,</hi> that profeſt Godlineſs and good Works.

And therefore all the <hi>holy Men</hi> and <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> are to mind that, which is more precious than <hi>Gold:</hi> who are <hi>Redeemed not with corruptible things, as Silver and Gold, from your vain Converſation;</hi> but <hi>with the precious Blood of Chriſt, as of a Lamb without blemiſh and without ſpot. Therefore as obedient Children to God, not faſhioning your ſelves according to your former Luſts in your Ignorance; but as he, which hath called you, is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo be ye holy in all manner of Converſation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.14, 15.</p>
                        <p>Chriſt ſaith; <hi>The Life is more than Meat, and the Body is more than Raiment,</hi> Luke 12.23.</p>
                        <p>I read of a Moral-wiſe <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> who, meeting a <hi>Woman</hi> with her <hi>Neck</hi> and <hi>Breaſt bare,</hi> laid his hand upon her, and ſaid; <hi>Woman, wilt thou ſell this Fleſh?</hi> and ſhe replying, <hi>No. Then pray,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>ſhut up your Shop</hi> (meaning her bare Breaſts and Neck.) So they were looked upon as <hi>Harlots,</hi> that went with their <hi>Necks, Breaſts</hi> and <hi>Backs bare,</hi> and not Civil People, even among the Moral <hi>Heathens.</hi> Therefore they, that profeſs the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of true <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> ſhould be aſhamed of ſuch things.

                     <p>THE <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> of the City of <hi>Dantzick</hi> ſay, That it is thy <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Command,</hi> that theſe Innocent and Afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed People ſhould ſuffer ſuch Oppreſſion. Now this Puniſhment is Inflicted upon them, only and alone, becauſe they come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> their Redeemer and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, who died for their Sins, and is riſen from the dead for their Juſtification: who is their <hi>Prophet,</hi> whom God hath raiſed up like unto <hi>Moſes;</hi> whom they ought to hear in all things in this day of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> and the <hi>New Covenant;</hi> who went aſtray like <hi>ſcattered Sheep;</hi> but now are returned to the <hi>Chief Shepherd</hi> and <hi>Biſhop</hi> of their <hi>Souls,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.25. <hi>Who has given his Life for his Sheep, and they hear his Voice, and follow him:</hi> who leads them into his <hi>Paſtures</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> John 10.</p>
                     <p>And now, <hi>O King!</hi> I underſtand, that thou openly profeſſeſt <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and the great and mighty <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> who is <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Lords,</hi> To whom is given all <hi>Power</hi> in Heaven and in Earth; who rules all Nations with a <hi>Rod</hi> of <hi>Iron.</hi> Therefore, <hi>O King,</hi> it ſeems hard to us, that any, that openly confeſſes <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> (yea, the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates</hi> of <hi>Dantzick</hi> do the ſame) ſhould Inflict thoſe Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon an <hi>Innocent</hi> and <hi>Harmleſs People,</hi> by reaſon of their <hi>Tender Conſciences,</hi> only and alone, becauſe they come together to <hi>ſerve</hi> and <hi>worſhip</hi> the Eternal God, who made them, in <hi>Spirit</hi> and in <hi>Truth;</hi> which <hi>worſhip Chriſt Jeſus</hi> has ſet up <hi>Sixteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years</hi> ago: as we read in <hi>John</hi> 4.23, 24.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, I beſeech the <hi>King,</hi> that he would Conſider, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> ever gave ſuch a Command to his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> that they ſhould ſhut up any in <hi>Priſon,</hi> and feed them with <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Water,</hi> who was not Conformable in every particular to their <hi>Religion, Faith</hi> and <hi>Worſhip?</hi> Or, where did the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> exerciſe ſuch things in the true <hi>Church</hi> after Chriſt's <hi>Aſcenſion?</hi> For is not this the Doctrine of <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
                        <pb n="540" facs="tcp:51448:358"/> and the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> that Chriſt's Followers ſhould <hi>Love their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, and pray for them that hate them, and perſecute and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitefully uſe them?</hi> Matth. 5.</p>
                     <p>And now, Is it not a ſhame to <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> among the <hi>Turks</hi> and others, That one <hi>Chriſtian</hi> ſhould perſecute <hi>another</hi> for the Doctrine of <hi>Faith, Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Religion?</hi> And they cannot prove, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ever gave them ſuch a Command, whom they profeſs to be their <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Maſter.</hi> For Chriſt ſays, that his Believers and Followers ſhould <hi>love one another;</hi> and by this they ſhall be known to be his <hi>Diſciples.</hi> And did not Chriſt Reprove thoſe, who would have <hi>fire to come down from Heaven,</hi> to deſtroy them, who would not receive him; and did not he tell them, <hi>They did not know, what ſpirit they were of?</hi> And therefore all, who have <hi>perſecuted</hi> Men, or taken away their <hi>Lives,</hi> becauſe they would not receive their <hi>Religion,</hi> have they known, what <hi>ſpirit</hi> they were or are of? Therefore is it nor good for all to know by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> what <hi>ſpirit</hi> they are of? For the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſays, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. <hi>If any Man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his.</hi> And does not the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle</hi> ſay, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. <hi>The Weapons of our Warfare are not Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, but Spiritual,</hi> &amp;c. And we <hi>wreſtle not againſt fleſh and blood, but against ſpiritual wickedneſs,</hi> &amp;c. Thus we can ſee here, that the <hi>Fight</hi> of the <hi>firſt Chriſtians,</hi> and their <hi>Weapons</hi> in the days of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> were <hi>ſpiritual</hi> in matters of Faith, Religion and Worſhip in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now would not the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> of <hi>Dantzick</hi> think, that it was contrary to their Conſciences, if they ſhould be forced by the <hi>Turk</hi> to his <hi>Religion?</hi> Would it not in like manner ſeem hard to the <hi>Magistrates</hi> of <hi>Dantzick,</hi> and contrary to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, if they ſhould be forced to the Religion of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Poland?</hi> or the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Poland,</hi> if he ſhould be compelled to the Religion of the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> of <hi>Dantzick?</hi> And if they would not be ſubject thereunto, that then they ſhould be <hi>ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed</hi> from their <hi>Wives</hi> and <hi>Families,</hi> and out of their <hi>Native Country,</hi> or otherwiſe be fed with <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Water</hi> under a ſtrict Confinement?</p>
                     <p>Therefore we beſeech the <hi>King</hi> with all Chriſtian Humility, and the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> of <hi>Dantzick,</hi> that they would order their proceedings in this matter according to the <hi>Royal Law</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which is, <hi>To do unto others, as they would have others do unto them; and to love their Neighbour, as themſelves.</hi> For we have this Charity, that we hope and believe, that the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and his People, with the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> of <hi>Dantzick,</hi> own the Writings of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> as well as of the <hi>Old:</hi> And therefore we beſeech the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> of <hi>Dantzick,</hi> to take heed, that their Work of <hi>Impriſoning</hi> an Innocent Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for nothing but their meeting together in Tenderneſs of Conſcience to <hi>ſerve</hi> and <hi>worſhip God,</hi> their Creator, may not be contrary and oppoſite to the <hi>Royal Law</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and to the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and Everlaſting <hi>Goſpel</hi> of <hi>Truth.</hi>

                           <hi>THE Natural Man receiveth not the Things of the Spirit of God, for they are fooliſhneſs to him, neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned: but he that is ſpiritual,
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:51448:359"/> judgeth all things</hi> (mark) <hi>all things; yet he himſelf is judged of no Man,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">1685. Enfield.</note> 1 Cor. 2.14, 15. So here the <hi>Natural Man</hi> cannot judge of thoſe things he receives not, for they are <hi>fooliſhneſs</hi> to him: but he is comprehended by the <hi>Spiritual Man,</hi> and his <hi>fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and is <hi>Judged,</hi> though he cannot judge the <hi>Spiritual Man.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Do not ye judge them that are within?</hi> ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle;</hi> (this Power the <hi>Church</hi> had, and hath) <hi>therefore put away from amongſt your ſelves that wicked perſon.</hi> And did not this <hi>Wicked perſon,</hi> think you, profeſs and plead for <hi>Liberty</hi> for his <hi>Wickedneſs,</hi> and his <hi>Freedom,</hi> as he was a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> who was lookt upon, as a <hi>Member</hi> of the <hi>Church?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith; <hi>For I verily, as abſent in body, yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in ſpirit, have judged already, as though I were preſent, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him that hath</hi> done <hi>this wicked deed,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.3, 12. Here the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> did <hi>Judge,</hi> though afar off, and ſet up <hi>Judgment</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> againſt <hi>falſe Liberty,</hi> under what pretence ſoever it was.</p>
                        <p>And the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith; <hi>Dare any of you, having a matter against a Brother, go to Law before the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt, and not before the Saints.</hi> Here the <hi>Saints,</hi> the <hi>Church,</hi> are to <hi>Judge</hi> of things amongſt themſelves; and not for the Unjuſt to Judge of their Matters. <hi>Do ye not know, the Saints ſhall judge the World?</hi> So the <hi>Saints</hi> are to judge the Unjuſt, and not the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt</hi> to judge their Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
                        <p>And farther the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith; <hi>If the World ſhall be judged by you,</hi> (to wit the <hi>Saints) are you unworthy to judge the ſmaller matters amongſt you?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>So here it is clear, that the <hi>Saints</hi> have a <hi>Judgment</hi> given them of Chriſt, by his <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Spirit, Light</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> to judge the World, and not to carry their Matters before the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt;</hi> but to judge of them amongſt themſelves: and if they carry them before the <hi>Unjuſt,</hi> they ſhew their unworthineſs of the <hi>Saints Judgment.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And further the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith; <hi>Know ye not, that we ſhall Judge the Angels?</hi> (and <hi>Angels</hi> are <hi>Spirits) how much more the things which pertain to this life?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>If ye then have Judgment of things pertaining to this life, ſet them up to judge, who have leaſt eſteem in the Church,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. So here it is clear, the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> has a <hi>Judgment</hi> in the Power and Spirit of God, not only to Judge in <hi>things that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to this life;</hi> but are alſo to <hi>Judge</hi> of things betwixt <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> without <hi>Brother</hi> going to Law with <hi>Brother</hi> before Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers: which was a fault, and to be <hi>Judged,</hi> if they did ſo.</p>
                        <p>But alſo the <hi>Saints</hi> have a <hi>Judgment</hi> to judge <hi>Angels,</hi> that kept not their Habitations; and the <hi>World.</hi> And as in <hi>Jude; He judged the Angels, that kept not their habitations;</hi> their <hi>firſt ſtate:</hi> And did not he Judge in <hi>Divine Matters</hi> here? and judged the <hi>ſtate</hi> of <hi>Cain,</hi> and <hi>Balaam,</hi> and <hi>Core,</hi> and ſuch like <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that were gotten into their <hi>ſteps,</hi> and were gone as far as they was, though they profeſſed themſelves <hi>Chriſtians?</hi> And here
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:51448:359"/> again he judged in <hi>Divine Matters,</hi> and of their <hi>States</hi> and <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;</hi> who ſtood in the <hi>Divine Principle,</hi> and who were fallen from it.</p>
                        <p>And the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith; <hi>Try the ſpirits, and believe not every ſpirit,</hi> 1 John 4. And here again was a <hi>Judgment</hi> in <hi>Divine Matters:</hi> And he judged ſuch, as <hi>went out from them;</hi> which whilſt they were with them, they had <hi>ſight</hi> of <hi>things</hi> and <hi>open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;</hi> but when they went from them, they went from the <hi>Anointing:</hi> and therefore he exhorts the <hi>Saints</hi> to keep to the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing.</hi> And ſuch as went from them, that had the <hi>Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> came to be the <hi>Seducers</hi> and <hi>falſe Prophets,</hi> that went into the <hi>World.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And <hi>John</hi> had a <hi>Judgment</hi> to try <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> and diſtinguiſhed <hi>Cains</hi> from <hi>Abels;</hi> and by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> knew, which <hi>God</hi> accepted, and which he did not accept: as in 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.12. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> judged and tried ſuch <hi>Meſſengers</hi> and <hi>Apostles,</hi> and <hi>Transformers</hi> of themſelves, like to the <hi>Apostles</hi> of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> and would have the <hi>Church</hi> to try ſuch, and have the ſame <hi>Judgment</hi> as he had, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</p>
                        <p>And the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> Judged <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> and judged the <hi>Thoughts</hi> of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> who would have been a worker of <hi>Miracles</hi> for <hi>money:</hi> and was not all this <hi>Judgment</hi> in <hi>Divine Matters?</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> Judged the <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> of <hi>Circumciſion</hi> both in the <hi>Romans,</hi> and in the <hi>Galatians.</hi> For it was the <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> of thoſe <hi>Preachers,</hi> to preach up <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> though it was a wrong Faith: And here did not the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> again Judge in <hi>Divine Matters?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And <hi>James</hi> Judged in Matters of <hi>Faith,</hi> and manifeſted the <hi>living</hi> Faith from the <hi>dead</hi> one. And alſo he Judged in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Religion,</hi> the vain Religion from the pure Religion; and diſtinguiſhed them.</p>
                        <p>And <hi>Paul</hi> Judged of the <hi>falſe Brethren, that would ſpy out the liberty of the true; to whom he would give no place by ſubjection, no, not for an hour, that the Truth of the Goſpel might continue with the Saints;</hi> as in <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. And did not the <hi>Apostle</hi> here Judge in <hi>Divine Matters?</hi> And he Judged concerning the Matters of the Goſpel, when ſome came to pervert them with another Goſpel, and ſaid; <hi>The Goſpel, which I received, is not of Man, neither was I taught it; but by the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 1.12. So here was a <hi>Judgment</hi> to diſtinguiſh the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of Chriſt from all other <hi>Goſpels,</hi> which was <hi>Accurſed,</hi> which is after Man, and received of <hi>Man,</hi> and taught of <hi>Man,</hi> and not by the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> Gal. 1. And he had a Judgment to know, <hi>Who made the Goſpel Chargeable, and who kept it without Charge.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And he ſet up a <hi>Judgment</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> that the <hi>Believers</hi> ſhould not be <hi>unequally yoked;</hi> and to ſee, when Men had a <hi>Communion in the Light,</hi> and when they had it in the <hi>Darkneſs;</hi> and when with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and when with <hi>Baal;</hi> and with the <hi>Believer,</hi> and <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbeliever;</hi> and with the <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and with <hi>Idols:</hi> as in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. And did he not ſet up a clear <hi>Judgment</hi> here in <hi>Divine Matters</hi> in the <hi>Church?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="544" facs="tcp:51448:360"/>
                        <p>And the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> Judged ſuch <hi>Libertines</hi> through their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that could ſit at <hi>Meat</hi> in the <hi>Idol-Temple;</hi> which <hi>cauſed the weak Brother to periſh through his knowledge and liberty, for whom Chriſt died.</hi> Now theſe, it's like, did profeſs, it was their <hi>Faith,</hi> and their <hi>Liberty;</hi> but did not keep in the <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>true Faith,</hi> but went about to deſtroy it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.</p>
                        <p>And <hi>Peter,</hi> he gives <hi>Judgment</hi> upon the <hi>Angels,</hi> that <hi>ſinned,</hi> and were caſt down into <hi>Hell:</hi> and the ſtate of the <hi>Old World,</hi> and of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and the ſtate of the <hi>falſe Prophets</hi> then amongſt them, that could ſpeak <hi>great ſwelling words of vanity; and whilſt they promiſed themſelves liberty, they themſelves were the Servants of Corruptions.</hi> And had not <hi>Peter</hi> here a Judgment in <hi>Divine Matters? Theſe were ſuch, whoſe work was to bring into bondage, and theſe was like the Dog and Sow, that was waſhed:</hi> which ſhews, that they had been <hi>waſhed;</hi> but was turned into the <hi>Mire</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> had a <hi>Judgment</hi> upon ſuch with their <hi>fair words</hi> and <hi>mens wiſdom,</hi> that deceived the hearts of the ſimple; and upon ſuch, as <hi>ſerved not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but their own Bellies, and were Enemies to the Croſs of Chriſt.</hi> And therefore he had a <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Diſcerning,</hi> who lived in the <hi>Croſs</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and who did not; and exhorted all to live in the <hi>Croſs</hi> of Chriſt, the righteous <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> that ſlew all Deceit, and the Deeds of the <hi>Old Man:</hi> agreeable to Chriſt's words, <hi>He that will be my Diſciple, muſt take up my Croſs, and follow me.</hi> And was not here a <hi>Judgment</hi> again in <hi>Divine Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> and of ſuch as walk in the Divine Power, and ſuch as did not?</p>
                        <p>And Chriſt ſets up a <hi>Judgment</hi> in his <hi>ſeven Churches,</hi> and commends them, that did keep in his <hi>Judgment,</hi> and had <hi>tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> them, which ſaid, <hi>They were Apoſtles;</hi> which might pretend, they were ſent of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and were not: But the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> had found them <hi>Liars.</hi> And Chriſt Commended this <hi>Judgment</hi> of the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> becauſe they had <hi>Not born with them, that was evil; but had tried thoſe falſe Apoſtles:</hi> And Chriſt commends this <hi>Church,</hi> for that they had <hi>hated the deeds of the</hi> Nicholaitans, <hi>which he alſo hated:</hi> And had not theſe <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholaitans</hi> ſprung from <hi>Nicholas,</hi> one of the <hi>Deacons?</hi> and was not theſe become a <hi>Sect</hi> of <hi>Chriſtians?</hi> though they might talk and <hi>preach</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but Chriſt <hi>hated</hi> them.</p>
                        <p>And likewiſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Smyrna, I know the blaſphemy of them, which ſay, they are</hi> Jews, <hi>but are not; but are of the Synagogue of</hi> Satan. So the <hi>Church</hi> is to have a <hi>Judgment</hi> upon theſe <hi>blaſphemers,</hi> and are to diſtinguiſh from the <hi>Jews</hi> in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and ſuch as are not, but of the <hi>Synagogue</hi> of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And to the <hi>Church</hi> in <hi>Pergamos</hi> Chriſt had a <hi>few things againſt them, becauſe thou haſt there them, that hold the Doctrines of</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam, <hi>&amp;c. And alſo them, that hold the Doctrine of the</hi> Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laitans, <hi>which I hate.</hi> Now, theſe that held the Doctrine of <hi>Balaam,</hi> and the Doctrine of the <hi>Nicholaitans,</hi> were got into the <hi>Church;</hi> and might have lookt upon themſelves to be high

                           <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and took a great Liberty to go into <hi>Balaam</hi>'s <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> and <hi>Nicholas</hi>'s <hi>Doctrine,</hi> which was <hi>hated</hi> by Chriſt: but the <hi>Church</hi> was to keep a <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Divine Judgment</hi> upon the Heads of all theſe.</p>
                        <p>And to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Thyatira</hi> ſaith Chriſt; <hi>I have a few things againſt thee, becauſe thou ſuffereſt the woman</hi> Jezabel <hi>to teach, which ſeduces my people,</hi> &amp;c. So here was a <hi>Suffering,</hi> which ſhould have been a <hi>Judgment</hi> by Chriſt's <hi>Spirit,</hi> upon that <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabel,</hi> which was erred from his <hi>Spirit,</hi> and ſo from <hi>Chriſt:</hi> and ſuch as theſe were <hi>high Preachers.</hi> And is not the <hi>Church</hi> to beware of <hi>ſuffering</hi> ſuch now; leſt they come under the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof</hi> of Chriſt, for not paſſing to <hi>Judgment</hi> againſt the <hi>falſe Teacher</hi> and <hi>Seducer?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Sardis,</hi> that <hi>had a name to live, but was dead, and their works were not found perfect before God.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here is a <hi>Judgment</hi> to be ſet up in the <hi>Church,</hi> to <hi>Judge</hi> all Imperfect Works, and ſuch as would have a <hi>Name,</hi> but not the <hi>Nature,</hi> or a name to <hi>live,</hi> but are <hi>dead:</hi> And therefore the <hi>Living</hi> muſt be in Chriſt, of all Chriſt's <hi>Church, living Members,</hi> and <hi>live</hi> to his <hi>Name.</hi> Though this <hi>Church</hi> had a <hi>few Names, that had not defiled their Garments, that did walk in White;</hi> But ſuch as had a <hi>Name</hi> to <hi>live,</hi> but are <hi>dead,</hi> whilſt they are in the <hi>dead state,</hi> they cannot <hi>walk in White,</hi> nor Judge in <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Matters. And behold,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I will make them of the Synagogue of</hi> Satan, <hi>which ſay, they are</hi> Jews, <hi>but are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come, and to worſhip before my feet.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> that was <hi>neither hot nor cold, but lukewarm; I would thou wert either cold or hot: I will ſpew thee out of my mouth, becauſe thou ſaid'ſt thou waſt rich, and wanted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;</hi> when they were <hi>wretched, miſerable, poor, blind and naked.</hi> Now this was for want of living in the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> theſe could talk of <hi>high Experiences,</hi> and great <hi>Injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> but was <hi>naked, miſerable</hi> and <hi>blind;</hi> So lived not in the <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by which they might be cloathed, and have the <hi>Eternal Riches.</hi> So the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> had a <hi>ſpiritual Judgment</hi> given to them, that are faithful, in his <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Light</hi> to Judge of <hi>Temporal things,</hi> and the things of this Life; and to Judge of <hi>Eternal</hi> and <hi>Divine things</hi> and <hi>States:</hi> and of Angels and Wicked men, and ſuch as goes from <hi>Truth;</hi> and of the ſtates of <hi>Election,</hi> and <hi>Reprobation;</hi> yea, and of the <hi>Devils,</hi> who is out of <hi>Truth;</hi> being in <hi>Christ Jeſus,</hi> who is the <hi>Firſt</hi> and <hi>Laſt,</hi> from whom they have the <hi>Eternal Judgment,</hi> to Judge <hi>Eternal, Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Divine things:</hi> And this <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> by which all things were made, and by which all things are upheld, in this <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> to order all things to <hi>God</hi>'s Glory, and to <hi>Judge</hi> of all things in Righteouſneſs.</p>

                              <hi>DEar Friends</hi> and <hi>Brethren</hi> in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in whom ye have all <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> and in him there is no <hi>Diviſion,</hi> nor <hi>Schiſm,</hi> nor <hi>Rent,</hi> nor <hi>Strife,</hi> nor <hi>Separation:</hi> for Chriſt is not divided, and there can be no <hi>Separation</hi> in the <hi>Truth,</hi> nor in the <hi>Light, Grace, Faith</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> but Unity and Fellowſhip, and Communion. For the <hi>Devil</hi> was the firſt, that went out of the <hi>Truth,</hi> and ſeparated from it; and tempted Man and Woman to diſobey God, and to go from the <hi>Truth</hi> into a <hi>falſe Liberty,</hi> to do that which God forbad. And ſo, it is the <hi>Serpent</hi> now, that leads Men and Women in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>falſe Liberty,</hi> even the <hi>God</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> from which Man and Woman muſt be ſeparated by the <hi>Truth;</hi> that <hi>Chriſt</hi> the <hi>Truth</hi> may make them <hi>free,</hi> and then they are <hi>free indeed.</hi> And then they are to ſtand faſt in that <hi>Liberty,</hi> in which <hi>Christ</hi> hath made them <hi>free;</hi> and in him (as I ſaid before) there is no <hi>Diviſion,</hi> nor <hi>Schiſm,</hi> nor <hi>Rent,</hi> nor <hi>Separation;</hi> but <hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>Reconciliation</hi> to God, and to one another. So that in Chriſt, <hi>Male</hi> and <hi>Female</hi> are all one: for whether they be <hi>Male</hi> or <hi>Female, Jew</hi> or <hi>Gentile, Bond</hi> or <hi>Free,</hi> they are all <hi>one</hi> in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And there can be no <hi>Schiſm, Rent</hi> or <hi>Diviſion</hi> in him; nor in the <hi>Worſhip</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in his holy <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Truth;</hi> nor in the pure and undefiled <hi>Religion,</hi> that keeps from the <hi>Spots</hi> of the <hi>World;</hi> nor in the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> that beareth and endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth all things; nor in the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God's Grace,</hi> for it is pure, and endureth for ever. Many, you ſee, have loſt the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Patience,</hi> and the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> that is pure, and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and gentle, and eaſie to be intreated: Then they run into
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:51448:364"/> the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> that is below, that is <hi>earthly, ſenſual</hi> and <hi>deviliſh,</hi> and very uneaſie to be intreated. And they go from the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> that beareth all things, and endureth all things, and thinks no Evil, and doth not behave it ſelf unſeemly; then they cannot bear, but grow <hi>brittle,</hi> and are eaſily provoked, and run into unſeemly things, and are in that, that vaunteth it ſelf, and are <hi>puffed</hi> up, and are <hi>raſh, heady, high-minded</hi> and <hi>fierce;</hi> and become as <hi>ſounding Braſs,</hi> or a <hi>tinkling Cymbal:</hi> but this is contrary to the nature of the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which is kind, and endureth all things, and beareth all things. And therefore, all <hi>Dear Friends</hi> and <hi>Brethren,</hi> dwell in the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> for they who dwell in <hi>Love,</hi> dwell in <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> in them. And keep in the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> that is gentle, pure and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; and in the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Patience,</hi> that endureth and beareth all things: which <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Patience</hi> the <hi>Devil,</hi> and the <hi>World,</hi> and all his <hi>Inſtruments</hi> can never wear out; It will wear <hi>them</hi> all out: for it was, before they were; and will be, when they are gone, the pure, holy <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> by which all God's Children are born again, and feed on the <hi>Milk</hi> thereof, and live and grow by it. And ſo, my deſires are, that ye may all be of one <hi>Heart, Mind, Soul</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>

                        <head>Concerning the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> being clothed with the Sun, and having the Moon under her feet.</head>
                        <p>THey are <hi>living Members</hi> and <hi>living Stones,</hi> which are built up a ſpiritual Houſhold, and are the Children of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and of the Seed and Fleſh of Chriſt; and as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith, <hi>Fleſh of his Fleſh, and Bone of his Bone.</hi> They are the good Seed, and are the Children of the Everlaſting Kingdom written in Heaven; and have put on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and they ſit together in the heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus, and ſo are clothed with the <hi>Sun</hi> of <hi>Righteouſneſs, Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and have the <hi>Moon</hi> under their <hi>feet,</hi> as <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. So all change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able things, that are in the World, and all changeable Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, and changeable Worſhips, and changeable Ways, and Fellowſhips, and Churches, and Teachers in the World, are as the <hi>Moon:</hi> For the <hi>Moon</hi> changes, but the <hi>Sun</hi> doth not change. And ſo the <hi>Sun</hi> of <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> never changeth, nor ſets, or goes down: But all the Ways, Religions, and Worſhips, and Fellowſhips of the World, and the <hi>Teachers</hi> thereof change, like the <hi>Moon.</hi> But the <hi>true Church,</hi> which Chriſt is the Head of, which is in God, the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which <hi>Church</hi> is called <hi>The Pillar</hi> and <hi>Ground</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> whoſe Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation is in Heaven; this <hi>Church</hi> is clothed with the <hi>Sun, Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> her <hi>Head,</hi> who doth not change, and hath all changeable things under her feet. Theſe are the <hi>living Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> born again of the Immortal Seed, by the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God,</hi>
                           <pb n="554" facs="tcp:51448:365"/> and feed upon the <hi>Immortal Milk,</hi> and live and grow by it. And ſuch are the <hi>New Creatures</hi> in Chriſt Jeſus, who makes all things new, and ſees the old things paſs away. And his <hi>Church,</hi> and all his <hi>Members,</hi> which are clothed with the <hi>Sun,</hi> their Worſhip is in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and in the <hi>Truth,</hi> which doth not change: which <hi>Truth</hi> the <hi>Devil,</hi> the foul, unclean Spirit, is out of, and cannot get into this <hi>Worſhip</hi> in <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Truth.</hi> And likewiſe the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> their Religion is pure and undefiled before God, that keeps from the <hi>Spots</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> &amp;c. and their Way is the new and living Way, Chriſt Jeſus. So the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that is clothed with the <hi>Sun,</hi> that hath the <hi>Moon</hi> and all changeable Religions and Ways under her feet, hath an unchangeable Worſhip, Religion and Way, and hath an unchangeable <hi>Rock</hi> and <hi>Foundation,</hi> Chriſt Jeſus, and an unchangeable <hi>High-Prieſt:</hi> and ſo are Children of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> and in the Everlaſting <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Life.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And now all, that profeſs the <hi>Scriptures</hi> both of the <hi>New</hi> and <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> and are not in Chriſt Jeſus, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells them, they are <hi>Reprobates,</hi> if <hi>Chriſt be not in them.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe, that be not in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> cannot be clothed with Chriſt, the <hi>Sun</hi> of <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> that never changes. And they that be not of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> be under the changeable <hi>Moon,</hi> in the <hi>World,</hi> in the changeable things, in the changeable Religions and Ways, and Worſhips and Teachers, and Rocks and Foundations. But <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and Sun of Righteouſneſs, doth not change; in whom his People are gathered, and ſit together in the heavenly places in him: And ſo are clothed with Chriſt Jeſus, the <hi>Sun,</hi> who is the <hi>Mountain,</hi> that filleth the whole Earth with his Divine <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Light.</hi> And ſo all his People ſee him, and feel him both by <hi>Sea</hi> and <hi>Land;</hi> ſo he is in all places of the Earth <hi>felt</hi> and <hi>ſeen</hi> of all his. And Chriſt Jeſus ſaith to the outward <hi>Profeſſors,</hi> the <hi>Jews, I am from above, ye are from below, or beneath; ye are of this World,</hi> to wit, that is <hi>beneath.</hi> And ſo their <hi>Religions, Worſhips, Ways, Teachers, Faiths, Beliefs</hi> and <hi>Creeds</hi> are made of Men, and are below, and of this World, that changeth like the <hi>Moon;</hi> and ye may ſee their <hi>Religions, Ways, Worſhips</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> they are all change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, like the <hi>Moon:</hi> but <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Sun,</hi> with which the <hi>Church</hi> is clothed, doth not change, nor his <hi>Church;</hi> for they are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually minded, and their Way, Worſhip and Religion is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, from Chriſt, who is from above, and not of this World. For Chriſt hath redeemed you from the <hi>World,</hi> and their change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Rudiments</hi> and <hi>Elements,</hi> and old things, and their change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Teachers,</hi> and from their changeable <hi>Faiths</hi> and <hi>Beliefs.</hi> For Chriſt is the Author and Finiſher of his <hi>Churches Faith,</hi> who is from above, and ſaith; <hi>Believe in the Light, that ye may become Children of the Light:</hi> And it is given them not only to <hi>believe,</hi> but to <hi>ſuffer</hi> for his Name. So this <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Belief</hi> is above all <hi>Faiths</hi> and <hi>Beliefs,</hi> which change, like the <hi>Moon.</hi> And <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>People</hi> are an holy Nation, a peculiar People, a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Houſhold, and Royal Prieſthood, offering up ſpiritual Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:51448:365"/> to God, by Jeſus Chriſt; and are <hi>zealous</hi> of righteous, god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, good works: and their <hi>Zeal</hi> is for that which is of God, againſt the <hi>Evil,</hi> which is not of God. And Chriſt took upon him the <hi>Seed</hi> of <hi>Abraham;</hi> he doth not ſay, the corrupt <hi>Seed</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> So according to the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> he was of the holy <hi>Seed</hi> of <hi>Abraham</hi> and of <hi>David;</hi> and his holy <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> was an Offering, and a Sacrifice for the Sins of the whole World, as a <hi>Lamb</hi> without <hi>blemiſh,</hi> whoſe Fleſh ſaw no Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. And ſo by the <hi>one Offering</hi> of himſelf in the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> and <hi>New Covenant,</hi> he has put an end to all the <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices</hi> amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> in the <hi>Old Teſtament.</hi> And Chriſt, the holy Seed, was crucified, dead and buried, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Fleſh, and raiſed again the <hi>third</hi> day; and his Fleſh ſaw no Corruption. Though he was crucified in the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> yet quickned again by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and is alive, and liveth for evermore; and hath all Power in Heaven and Earth given to him, and reigneth over all: and is the One <hi>Mediator</hi> betwixt <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> even the Man Chriſt Jeſus. And Chriſt ſaid, <hi>He gave his fleſh for the life of the World:</hi> And the <hi>Apostle</hi> ſaith; <hi>His Fleſh ſaw no Corruption:</hi> So that which ſaw no <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,</hi> he gave for the life of the <hi>corrupt World,</hi> to bring them out of <hi>Corruption.</hi> And Chriſt ſaid again, <hi>He that eateth my Fleſh, and drinketh my Blood, hath eternal life: for my Fleſh is Meat indeed, and my Blood is Drink indeed. And he that eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth my Fleſh, and drinketh my Blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.</hi> And he that eats not his Fleſh, and drinks not his Blood, which is the life of the Fleſh, hath not <hi>Eternal Life.</hi> Now, as the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle</hi> ſaith, <hi>All died in</hi> Adam: Then all are <hi>dead.</hi> Now all coming ſpiritually to eat the <hi>Fleſh</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>ſecond Adam,</hi> and drink his <hi>Blood;</hi> his <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Fleſh</hi> gives all the Dead in <hi>Adam life,</hi> and quickens them out of their ſins and treſpaſſes, in which they were <hi>dead:</hi> and ſo they come to ſit together in the heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus, and ſo are living Members of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that he is the Head of; and are clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with the <hi>Sun,</hi> the <hi>Sun</hi> of <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> that never changes, and have the changeable <hi>Moon</hi> under their <hi>feet,</hi> and all changeable, worldly things and inventions, and works of mens hands; and do ſee the People, how that they do change from one <hi>Worſhip</hi> to another, and from one <hi>Religion</hi> to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and from one <hi>Way</hi> to another, and one <hi>Church</hi> to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and yet their <hi>hearts</hi> are not <hi>changed.</hi> And the <hi>Letter</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> is read by the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> like the <hi>Jews;</hi> but the <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery</hi> is hid: They have the <hi>Sheeps-clothing,</hi> the outſide, but are inwardly ravened from the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which ſhould bring them into the <hi>Lamb's</hi> and <hi>Sheep's Nature.</hi> The <hi>Scripture</hi> ſaith, <hi>All the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſed muſt go down into the Pit:</hi> And therefore all muſt be <hi>Circumciſed</hi> with the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which puts off the Body of Death, and Sins of the Fleſh, that came into Man and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man by their Diſobedience, and tranſgreſſing of God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.

Thoſe <hi>Jews,</hi> that refuſed the running Waters of <hi>Shiloh,</hi> the Floods and Waters of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> and <hi>Babylonians</hi> came over them, and carried them into Captivity: And they that refuſe the <hi>Waters</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they are overflown with the <hi>Flood</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> that lieth in Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs.

Theſe are the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> that the Lord requires of his People, more than Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Sacrifices.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>Let my Prayer be ſet forth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, as Incenſe; and the lifting up of mine Hands, as the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening Sacrifice,</hi> Pſal. 141.2. So here <hi>David</hi> looks upon his <hi>Prayer</hi> to the <hi>Lord,</hi> and the lifting up of his Hands to him, to be accepted with the Lord, as much as the Outward Incenſe, and the Outward Evening Sacrifice. Again <hi>David</hi> ſays, <hi>The Sacrifices of God are a broken ſpirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not deſpiſe,</hi> Pſal. 51.17. (See alſo <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.15. and <hi>chap.</hi> 66.2.) Theſe be the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> that <hi>David</hi> ſaid God would accept, and not deſpiſe; which are beyond the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broken
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:51448:371"/> Spirit, and uncontrite heart, with Outward <hi>Offerings</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Adverſaries</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> would have joined with them towards the building of the <hi>Temple,</hi> ſaying unto them; <hi>Let us build with you, for we ſeek your God, as ye do; and we do ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice unto him.</hi> But the <hi>Jews</hi> refuſed them, and ſaid; <hi>You have nothing to do with us, to build an Houſe unto our God, Ezra</hi> 4.2, 3. So here ye may ſee, that <hi>God's People</hi> refuſed their <hi>build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> with them, and their <hi>ſacrifice.</hi> And <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Wicked is an Abomination to the Lord,</hi> Prov. 15.8. (See alſo <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.11. and <hi>chap.</hi> 66.3.) <hi>Solomon</hi> alſo ſaith, <hi>Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is a dry Morſel, and quietneſs therewith, than an houſe full of Sacrifices with ſtrife,</hi> Prov. 17.1. Now let all People Conſider, what Good your houſe full of Sacrifices doth with ſtrife, when a dry Morſel, and Quietneſs therewith is better? And Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all People, If ye live in <hi>Wickedneſs,</hi> your <hi>Sacrifice</hi> is an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination to the Lord.</p>
                        <p>Again, <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaking of the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>Fools,</hi> ſaith; <hi>They conſider not, that they do evil,</hi> Eccleſ. 5.1. <hi>Fools</hi> are ſuch, as do not walk in the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> or begin in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and end in the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> like the fooliſh <hi>Galatians:</hi> for the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is the Spirit of Wiſdom and Underſtanding, and cannot Join with the Sacrifices of the <hi>Dead,</hi> nor of the <hi>Fools,</hi> nor of the <hi>Wicked,</hi> whoſe Sacrifice is Abominable; who grieve and quench the Spirit of God: by which <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> the Spiritual and Righteous offer up Spiritual <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> acceptable to God by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, he was the <hi>Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt to the Gentiles, miniſtring the Goſpel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being ſanctified by the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Rom. 15.16. So ye may ſee, that all the acceptable <hi>Offerings</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices</hi> to God muſt be ſanctified by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> The ſame <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith to the <hi>Corinthians; Ye are bought with a</hi> price: <hi>therefore glorifie God in your Body, and in your Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which are God</hi>'s, 1 Cor. 6.20. And to the <hi>Romans</hi> he ſaith; <hi>I beſeech you, Brethren, by the Mercies of God, that you preſent your Bodies a living Sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reaſonable Service,</hi> Rom. 12.1. Now this is the duty of all true Chriſtians.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Peter</hi> alſo ſaith in his general <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt; Ye alſo as lively ſtones, are built up a ſpiritual houſe, an holy Prieſt-hood to offer up ſpiritual Sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.5. So every Man and Woman muſt come to the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in their own hearts, if they do offer up <hi>ſpiritual Sacrifices,</hi> acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt. For as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Every Sacrifice ſhall be ſalted with ſalt,</hi> Mark 9.49. And in the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> ye may ſee, All their outward <hi>Offerings,</hi> they were to <hi>ſeaſon them with ſalt,</hi> Levit. 2.13. a Type and Figure of Chriſt, who <hi>gave himſelf for us, an Offering and a Sacrifice to God, for a ſweet-ſmelling ſavour,</hi> Epheſ. 5.2. Therefore all his People muſt be baptized
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:51448:371"/> with the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> and with <hi>Fire,</hi> that they may be ſalted with <hi>Fire,</hi> and every Sacrifice ſalted with <hi>ſalt,</hi> with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of <hi>Grace,</hi> that is poured upon all: ſo that they may offer up this ſpiritual Sacrifice, acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaid to King <hi>Saul; Hath the Lord as great delight in Burnt-offerings and Sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? behold, to obey is better than Sacrifice; and to hearken, than the fat of Rams,</hi> 1 Sam. 15.22. So ye may ſee, All <hi>Offerings</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices</hi> are nothing, if there be not an hearkening to the Lord in his Spirit, and an obeying of his voice. And Chriſt told the <hi>Jews,</hi> that were outward <hi>Sacrificers,</hi> that he would have <hi>Mercy,</hi> and not <hi>Sacrifice:</hi> and bid them <hi>Go and learn, what that meaneth,</hi> Matth. 9.13.</p>

And <hi>Chriſt,</hi> after he was <hi>Riſen,</hi> ſaid unto his <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, That</hi> Repentance <hi>and Remiſſion of ſins ſhould be preached in his Name among all Nations, beginning at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.47. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid unto the <hi>Jews,</hi> Repent, <hi>and be baptized every one of you in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, for the Remiſſion of ſins; and ye ſhall receive the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Acts 2.38. And <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>The times of this Ignorance God winked at; but now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth all Men every where to</hi> Repent, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.30. <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> was called to <hi>Repentance,</hi> if he had regarded it, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.22. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> did preach at <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> and at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and throughout all the Coaſts of <hi>Judea,</hi> and then to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> (turning them from Darkneſs to the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and from the Power of <hi>Satan</hi> to <hi>God</hi>) that they ſhould <hi>Repent and turn to God, and do works meet for</hi> Repentance, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.20.</p>
                        <p>Now here ye may ſee, that People muſt <hi>Repent,</hi> before they do believe, and are <hi>baptized,</hi> and before they receive the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and the Kingdom of God; And they muſt <hi>Repent</hi> of their vain Life and Converſation, before they do receive the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> and muſt be turned from <hi>Darkneſs</hi> to the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and from the power of <hi>Satan</hi> unto <hi>God,</hi> before they do receive his <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> and his <hi>Goſpel</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Salvation.</hi> The <hi>Lord</hi> doth command all Men every where to <hi>Repent,</hi> and do works meet

                           <hi>CHriſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>I am the Way, the Truth and the Life; no Man cometh unto the Father, but by me,</hi> John 14.6.

And Chriſt, by whom are all things, is ſaid <hi>To bring many Sons to Glory,</hi> Hebr. 2.10.</p>
                        <p>Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Wo unto you Scribes and Phariſees, Hypocrites; for ye ſhut up the Kingdom of Heaven againſt Men; for ye neither go in your ſelves, neither ſuffer ye them, that are entring, to goin,</hi> Matth. 23.13. He alſo ſaid, <hi>Wo unto you Lawyers; for ye

For no Man knows the things of God, but by the Spirit of God;</hi> for the <hi>Things</hi> of <hi>God</hi> are ſpiritually diſcerned. So the <hi>Spirit</hi> is the <hi>Key,</hi> by which the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Things</hi> of <hi>God</hi> are revealed, and diſcerned, and known, according to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10, 11, 13, 14. The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> names ſome in his <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> and ſays; <hi>Theſe are my Fellow-workers unto the Kingdom of God,</hi> Col. 4.11.

So ye may ſee, theſe were born again, that were tranſlated into the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and were <hi>Fellow-workers</hi> unto the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>God.</hi>

                        <p>Chriſt exhorts his Diſciples to <hi>Love,</hi> and to <hi>do Good;</hi> that they might be the <hi>Children</hi> of their <hi>Father,</hi> which is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.45.

And the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle</hi> ſaith to the <hi>Church</hi> at <hi>Philippi; That ye may be blameleſs and harmleſs, the Sons of God, without Rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverſe Nation;</hi> amongſt whom ye ſhine, as <hi>Lights</hi> in the <hi>World,</hi> holding forth the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.15, 16. And writing to the <hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> he puts them in mind, how he had exhorted them, That they would <hi>Walk worthy of God, who had called them into his Kingdom and Glory,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 2.12.</p>
                        <p>The Lord had promiſed by the Prophet <hi>Joel,</hi> that he would <hi>Pour out his Spirit upon all Fleſh,</hi> and that <hi>Sons and Daughters ſhould Propheſie; Old men ſhould dream Dreams, and Young-men ſee Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> Joel 2.28. Now the Cauſe, that <hi>Sons</hi> and <hi>Daughters, Hand-maids, Servants, Young-men</hi> and <hi>Old men</hi> have not theſe heavenly <hi>Viſions, Dreams</hi> and <hi>Prophecies,</hi> is, becauſe they are <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the Spirit of God,</hi> which he poureth upon them: but as many as are led by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> are the <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>God.</hi>

                           <hi>John</hi> ſaith, Chriſt was the <hi>True Light, which lighteth every Man, that cometh into the World,</hi> John 1.9. And that, <hi>As ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as received him, to them gave he power, to become the Sons of God,</hi> ver. 12. <hi>which were born not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God,</hi> ver. 13. Now, the Reaſon, why People do not become the <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> is, becauſe they do not receive <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The <hi>Jews,</hi> the great <hi>Profeſſors,</hi> which had the <hi>Promiſes, Prophecies, Figures</hi> and <hi>Shadows</hi> of him, they would not <hi>receive</hi> him, when he came.

For the <hi>Light,</hi> that ſhines in the heart, gives the <hi>Light of the Knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> And they that do not receive <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> but hate his <hi>Light</hi> (which is the <hi>Life</hi> in him) and yet profeſs him in words; ſuch neither know the <hi>Children</hi> of the <hi>Light,</hi> nor true <hi>Fellowſhip</hi> in the <hi>Light,</hi> nor the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> that ſtands in Righteouſneſs, Peace and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt: but by the <hi>Light</hi> they are condemned. <hi>And this is the Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that Light is come into the World, and Men love Darkneſs ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than Light, becauſe their deeds are evil.

Chriſt ſaid to the <hi>Jews, Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have eternal life; and they are they, which teſtifie of me: And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life,</hi> John 5.39, 40.

This is the true and ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial <hi>Belief,</hi> which they that do believe, ſhall not periſh, but have <hi>Everlaſting life.

Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Every one that hath forſaken Houſes, or Brethren, or Siſters, or Father, or Mother, or Wife, or Children, or Lands for my Names ſake, ſhall receive an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fold, and ſhall inherit everlaſting life,</hi> Matth. 19.29.

                        <p>WHen <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Stone,</hi> that became a <hi>great Mountain,</hi> and filled the whole Earth, had broke to pieces the <hi>Head</hi> of <hi>Gold,</hi> and the <hi>Breaſt</hi> of <hi>Silver,</hi> and the <hi>Belly</hi> of <hi>Braſs,</hi> and the <hi>Legs</hi> of <hi>Iron,</hi> and the <hi>Feet</hi> part <hi>Iron</hi> part <hi>Clay</hi> (which were the <hi>four Monarchies,</hi> to wit, the <hi>Babylonian</hi> and <hi>Mede,</hi> the <hi>Perſian,</hi> the <hi>Grecian,</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi>) and had ended the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

                           <hi>Jews Typical Kingdom; Daniel</hi> ſaith, <hi>In the days of theſe Kings ſhall the God of Heaven ſet up a Kingdom, which ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be destroyed,</hi> Dan. 2.44. Chriſt ſaith; <hi>All Power is given unto me in Heaven and in Earth,</hi> Matth. 28.18. And he ſaith, <hi>My Kingdom is not of this World,</hi> John 18.36. And <hi>Chriſt is the Image of the Inviſible God, the Firſt-born of every Creature. For by him were all things created, that are in Heaven, and that are in Earth, viſible, and inviſible, whether they be Thrones, or Dominions, or Principalities, or Powers: all things were created by him, and for him; and he is before all things, and by him all things conſiſt,</hi> Col. 1.15, 16, 17. Here ye may ſee, All things Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and all things were Created by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and for him, whether they be things in Heaven, or things in Earth, viſible or inviſible, they were Created by him and for him; yea, Thrones, Dominions, or Principalities, or Powers, theſe were all created by him and for him. So Chriſt is <hi>King of Kings and Lord of Lords,</hi> Rev. 19.16. And the <hi>Prince of the Kings of the Earth,</hi> Chap. 1.5. And out of his <hi>Mouth</hi> goes a ſharp <hi>Sword,</hi> with which he ſhall ſmite the <hi>Nations;</hi> and he ſhall rule them with a <hi>Rod</hi> of <hi>Iron:</hi> As the <hi>Veſſel</hi> of a <hi>Potter</hi> ſhall they be daſhed in pieces, who do not obey him, who is <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Lords.</hi> This is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by whom all things were made, who doth rule the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> who ſaith; <hi>I am Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the Ending, the Firſt and the Laſt:</hi> So he is over all <hi>Nations,</hi> and above them all. Now we muſt underſtand, this <hi>Rod</hi> of <hi>Iron,</hi> by which Chriſt, who is the <hi>Firſt</hi> and <hi>Laſt,</hi> doth rule the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> is a <hi>Figurative Speech</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who is Aſcended into Heaven, and is at the right hand of God; yet all Power in Heaven and Earth is given unto him, and <hi>All things</hi> were cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by him and for him: So then, they are <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s, and he hath <hi>power</hi> over <hi>all things;</hi> for all are his. So, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith, <hi>By me Kings Reign, and Princes decree Juſtice,</hi> Prov. 8.15. But if they abuſe his Power, and do not do <hi>Juſtice,</hi> as is decreed by Chriſt, the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Lords,</hi> the <hi>Firſt</hi> and the <hi>Laſt;</hi> they muſt feel and know the <hi>weight</hi> of his <hi>Rod</hi> of <hi>Iron,</hi> by which he will rule ſuch, as abuſe his Power, and do not do <hi>Justice</hi> (that is decreed by him) who hath all Power in Heaven and Earth given to him, and rules in the <hi>Kingdoms</hi> of <hi>Men.</hi>

                        <p>And Chriſt ſaid to the <hi>Jews; That the Dead are raiſed, even</hi> Moſes <hi>ſhewed at the Buſh, when he calleth the Lord, the God of</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, <hi>and the God of</hi> Iſaac, <hi>and the God of</hi> Jacob: <hi>for he is not the God of the Dead, but of the Living; for all live unto him,</hi> Luke 20.37, 38. So, <hi>None of us liveth to himſelf, and no man dieth to himſelf: For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord. Whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's. For to this end Chriſt both died, and roſe, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,</hi> Rom. 14.7, 8, 9. For all died in <hi>Adam:</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> by the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>God</hi> taſted <hi>death</hi> for every Man, that they might come out of the <hi>death</hi> in <hi>Adam,</hi> to the <hi>Eternal life</hi> in Jeſus Chriſt. Who is alſo a <hi>quickening Spirit:</hi> for as in <hi>Adam</hi> all died; even ſo in <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall all be made alive.

Is this your preſent <hi>Life?</hi> for <hi>the Juſt live by the faith</hi> which Chriſt is the Author and Finiſher of: by which holy, divine and precious <hi>Faith</hi> they have <hi>Victory</hi> over that, which is <hi>vile</hi> and <hi>unholy,</hi> and is not divine; and in this <hi>Faith</hi> they do pleaſe God, and have Acceſs to God and his <hi>Son,</hi> who fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Prophets.</hi> For the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi> were until <hi>John;</hi> and ſince that, the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>God</hi> hath been preached, and Men do preſs into it: And the <hi>Least</hi> in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God is <hi>Greater</hi> than <hi>John,</hi> though he was the <hi>greateſt Prophet</hi> born of a Woman. So ſee, whether ye are in the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> that ſtands in Peace and Righteouſneſs and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt, or not. Chriſt, who is the Image of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible God, the Firſt-born of every Creature, was before any Creature; for by him were all things created, that are in Heaven and that are in the Earth, viſible or inviſible, whether they be Thrones, or Dominions, or Principalities, or Powers, <hi>all things were created by him and for him, and he was before all things, and by him all things conſiſt: And he is the Head of the Body, the Church, and is the beginning, the Firſt-born from the dead.</hi>

And, <hi>If a Man ſay, I love God, and hateth his Brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his Brother, whom he hath ſeen, how can he love God whom he hath not ſeen? And this Commandment have we from God, that he who loveth God, loveth his Brother alſo,</hi> Chap. 4.20, 21.

                     <hi>DEar Friends</hi> and <hi>Brethren</hi> in the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> whom the Lord by his Eternal <hi>Arm</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> hath upheld through your great <hi>Sufferings, Exerciſes, Trials</hi> and <hi>Hardſhips</hi> (more, I believe, then can be uttered) up and down that <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which I am very ſenſible of; and the reſt of the faithful <hi>Friends,</hi> that have been Partakers with you in your <hi>Sufferings:</hi> and cannot but ſuffer with the <hi>Lord's People,</hi> that <hi>ſuffer.</hi> And my Confidence hath been in the <hi>Lord,</hi> that he would and will <hi>ſupport</hi> you in all your <hi>Sufferings;</hi> and that he would preſerve all the <hi>Faithful</hi> in his <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> that they would give no <hi>juſt Occaſion</hi> to one nor other to make them <hi>ſuffer:</hi> And therefore, if that you did <hi>ſuffer wrongfully,</hi> or <hi>unjuſtly,</hi> the righteous <hi>God</hi> would aſſiſt you, and uphold you; and reward them according to their <hi>Works,</hi> that <hi>oppreſt</hi> or <hi>wronged</hi> you. And now my deſire is unto the <hi>Lord,</hi> that in the ſame holy and heavenly <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of <hi>God</hi> ye may all be preſerved to the <hi>End</hi> of your <hi>days,</hi> to the <hi>Glory</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> minding God Almighty's ſupporting Hand and Power: who is God Al-ſufficient, to ſtrengthen, help and refreſh in <hi>time</hi> of <hi>Need.</hi> And let none forget the Lord's <hi>Mercies</hi> and <hi>Kindneſſes,</hi> which endure for ever: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways live in the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of them.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> next day, <hi>after he had written the foregoing</hi> Epiſtle <hi>to</hi> Friends <hi>in</hi> Ireland, <hi>be went to the</hi> Meeting <hi>at</hi> Gracious-ſtreet, <hi>which was large (it being on the</hi> Firſt-day <hi>of the</hi> Week:) <hi>And the</hi> Lord <hi>ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him to</hi> preach <hi>the</hi> Truth fully <hi>and</hi> effectually, <hi>opening many</hi> deep <hi>and</hi> weighty things <hi>with great Power and Clearneſs. After which having</hi> Prayed, <hi>and the Meeting being ended, he went to</hi> Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Gouldney<hi>'s (a Friend's Houſe in</hi> Whitehart-Court, <hi>near the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing houſe:) and ſome</hi> Friends <hi>going with him thither, he told them,</hi> 
               <q>He thought, he felt the <hi>Cold</hi> ſtrike to his heart, as he came out of the Meeting; <hi>yet added,</hi> I am glad I was here: Now I am clear, I am fully clear.</q> 
               <hi>As ſoon as thoſe</hi> Friends, <hi>that were with him, were withdrawn, he lay down upon a</hi> Bed <hi>(as he ſometimes uſed to do, through Wearineſs after a Meeting) but ſoon roſe again; and in a little time lay down again, complaining ſtill of</hi> Cold. <hi>And his Strength ſenſibly decaying, he was fain ſoon after to go into</hi> Bed; <hi>where he lay in much Contentment and Peace, and very ſenſible to the</hi> Laſt. <hi>And as in the whole Courſe of his Life, his Spirit in the univerſal Love of God, was ſet and bent for the exalting of Truth and Righteouſneſs, and the making known the Way thereof to the Nations and Peoples afar off; ſo now, in the time of his outward Weakneſs, his Mind was intent upon, and (as it were) wholly taken up with that: And ſome particular</hi> Friends <hi>he ſent for, to whom he expreſt his Mind and Deſire for the</hi> Spreading <hi>Friends</hi> Books, <hi>and</hi> Truth <hi>thereby in the World, and through the Nations thereof. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> Friends <hi>came to viſit him in his Ilneſs; unto ſome of whom he
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:51448:395"/> ſaid,</hi> 
               <q>All is well: The <hi>Seed</hi> of God reigns over all, and over <hi>Death</hi> it ſelf. And though <hi>(ſaid he)</hi> I am weak in Body; yet the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is over all, and the <hi>Seed</hi> reigns over all diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly Spirits.</q> Thus lying in an heavenly frame of Mind, his Spirit wholly exerciſed towards the <hi>Lord,</hi> he grew weaker and weaker in his natural Strength; and on the <hi>Third day</hi> of that <hi>Week,</hi> between the <hi>hours</hi> of <hi>Nine</hi> and <hi>Ten</hi> in the Evening, he quietly departed this Life in Peace, and ſweetly fell aſleep in the <hi>Lord,</hi> whoſe bleſſed Truth he had livingly and powerfully preached in the Meeting but <hi>two days</hi> before. Thus ended he his Days in his faithful Teſtimony, in perfect Love and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity with his Brethren, and in Peace and Good-will to all Men, on the <hi>13th day</hi> of the <hi>11th Month 1690.</hi> being then in the <hi>67th year</hi> of his <hi>Age.</hi>

            <p>After the Meeting was ended, his Body was born by <hi>Friends,</hi> and accompanied by very great Numbers of <hi>Friends,</hi> and other People, to <hi>Friends Burying-Ground</hi> near <hi>Bunhill-Fields:</hi> where, after a ſolemn Waiting upon the Lord, and ſeveral living Testimonies borne, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the Company to the Guidance and Protection of that Divine Spirit and Power, by which this holy <hi>Man</hi> of <hi>God</hi> had been raiſed up, furniſhed, ſupported and preſerved to the end of his Day, his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was decently committed to the Earth; but his Memorial ſhall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, and be Everlaſtingly Bleſſed among the Righteous.</p>

                  <p>WHere did ever <hi>Chriſt</hi> or his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Command any Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers or <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to obſerve <hi>Holy-Days</hi> or <hi>Feaſt-Days?</hi> and let us ſee, where it is written in the <hi>Scriptures</hi> of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> in the <hi>Four Evangeliſts,</hi> or the <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> or the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,</hi> that ever <hi>Chriſt</hi> or his <hi>Apostles</hi> gave the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> any ſuch Command, that they ſhould obſerve the Time called <hi>Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> or a Day for <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Birth?</hi> or that they ſhould obſerve the Time called <hi>Eaſter,</hi> or <hi>Whitſuntide,</hi> or <hi>Peter,</hi> or <hi>Paul</hi>'s, or <hi>Mark</hi> or <hi>Luke</hi>'s <hi>Days,</hi> or any other <hi>Saints Day?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now you, that profeſs your ſelves to be the <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> from the <hi>Papiſts, Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathen,</hi> and the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to be your <hi>Rule,</hi> and are Profeſſors of the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> where do you prove out of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> that the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles</hi> and the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> practiſed or forced any ſuch thing, or that <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> gave any ſuch <hi>Command</hi> to the <hi>Churches,</hi> that they ſhould practiſe and obſerve any ſuch <hi>Days?</hi> Let us ſee, where this <hi>Command</hi> is written. For did not the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi> ſay unto the <hi>Galatians</hi> in the <hi>fourth Chapter; But now, after that ye have known God, or rather ye are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly Elements, whereunto ye deſire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to be in bondage? Ye obſerve Days, and Months, and Times and Years; I am afraid of you, leſt I have bestowed upon you La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in vain.</hi> And in the <hi>Third</hi> of <hi>Galatians</hi> it is ſaid; <hi>O foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Galatians, <hi>who hath bewitched you, that you ſhould not obey the Truth,</hi> &amp;c.

                  </p>
                  <p>Now doth not this manifeſt, that there were ſome <hi>Teachers,</hi> that were drawing the Church of the <hi>Galatians</hi> into theſe <hi>beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly Elements,</hi> and bringing them again into <hi>Bondage,</hi> in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of <hi>Days, Months, Times</hi> and <hi>Years?</hi> for it was the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi>'s <hi>Work</hi> to bring them out of thoſe <hi>Bondages</hi> and <hi>beggarly E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements;</hi> and therefore, when they were going back again into obſerving <hi>Days, Months, Times</hi> and <hi>Years,</hi> he was <hi>afraid,</hi> that he had <hi>beſtowed his Labour upon them in vain:</hi> and he Exhorts them, to <hi>ſtand fast in the Liberty, wherewith Chriſt Jeſus hath made them free, and not to be entangled again with the Yoke of Bondage:</hi> and
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:51448:398"/> 
                     <hi>Again</hi> ſignifies, <hi>That they had been once entangled with that Yoke of Bondage and beggarly Elements.</hi> But O! how are <hi>People,</hi> called <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> ſince the <hi>Apostles Days</hi> gone again under this <hi>Yoke</hi> of <hi>Bondage,</hi> and theſe <hi>beggarly Elements,</hi> in obſerving <hi>Days, Months, Times</hi> and <hi>Years,</hi> let their practice declare. Nay, do not both <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants</hi> force People to obſerve <hi>Days, Months</hi> and <hi>Times?</hi> &amp;c. And therefore is not the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s <hi>Labour</hi> and <hi>Travel</hi> beſtowed upon <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> in vain, which was to bring People from under ſuch <hi>beggarly Elements</hi> and that <hi>Yoke</hi> of <hi>Bondage,</hi> (which the <hi>Law</hi> did require;) to <hi>ſtand faſt in the Liberty, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Chriſt hath made them free, and not to be entangled again with the Yoke of Bondage?</hi> So it was and is Chriſt, that hath made and doth make his People free, from theſe things and <hi>beggarly Elements.</hi> And therefore they that are Redeemed, are to <hi>ſtand faſt in that Liberty, wherewith Chriſt hath made them free.</hi> And this <hi>Liberty,</hi> which all true <hi>Christians</hi> are to <hi>ſtand faſt</hi> in, they are made <hi>free</hi> by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and not by <hi>Man;</hi> for <hi>Man</hi> with out the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Mind</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſeeks to <hi>force</hi> and <hi>compel</hi> Chriſt's Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, and ſuch as he hath made <hi>free</hi> from the <hi>Yoke</hi> of <hi>Bondage,</hi> to <hi>outward things,</hi> that the <hi>Law</hi> commanded, and to the obſerving of <hi>Days, Months, Times, Feaſts</hi> and <hi>Years:</hi> ſuch weak, <hi>beggarly Elements,</hi> them that know <hi>God,</hi> or are known of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt;</hi> are to <hi>ſtand faſt</hi> in their <hi>Liberty,</hi> and not come under, nor be <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled</hi> with the <hi>Yoke</hi> of <hi>Bondage</hi> of ſuch things again, ſeeing, he hath made them <hi>free.</hi> For they that are in <hi>ſuch things,</hi> and would <hi>force</hi> others to them, are gone from that, which gives them the <hi>knowledge</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> and have not <hi>ſtood faſt</hi> in the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</hi> wherewith <hi>Chriſt</hi> makes <hi>free.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now concerning <hi>Prayer,</hi> we do not read, that ever <hi>Chriſt</hi> or his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did <hi>Compel</hi> by <hi>force</hi> any to <hi>Faſt</hi> or <hi>Pray,</hi> and make a <hi>Law</hi> to <hi>ſtrain</hi> the <hi>Goods</hi> of ſuch, as would not obſerve <hi>Days</hi> to <hi>faſt</hi> and <hi>pray</hi> with them. But Chriſt taught them, how they ſhould <hi>pray,</hi> and be diſtinct from the <hi>Hypocrites;</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s words are as followeth: <hi>When thou prayeſt, thou ſhalt not be, as the Hypocrites are; for they love to ſtand praying in the Synagogues; and in the Corners of the Streets, that they may be ſeen of Men,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But when thou prayest, enter into thy Cloſet, and when thou haſt ſhut thy door, pray to thy Father, which is in ſecret, and thy Father, that ſeeth in ſecret, will Reward thee openly. But when you</hi> pray, <hi>uſe not vain Repetitions, as the</hi> Heathen <hi>do; for they think, that they ſhall be heard for their much ſpeaking. Be not ye therefore like them; for your Father knoweth, what things ye have need of, before ye ask him,</hi> &amp;c. So as the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Saints</hi> did, ſo do we; we <hi>pray</hi> in <hi>ſecret,</hi> and we <hi>pray</hi> in <hi>publick,</hi> as the <hi>Spirit</hi> gives us utterance, which helps our <hi>Infirmities,</hi> as it did the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and true <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> and after this manner we <hi>pray</hi> for our ſelves, and <hi>pray</hi> for all Men both <hi>high</hi> and <hi>low.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Concerning <hi>Fasting, Chriſt</hi> ſaith; <hi>Moreover when ye</hi> faſt, <hi>be not as the Hypocrites of a ſad Countenance; for they disfigure their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that they may appear unto Men to</hi> faſt. <hi>But when thou</hi> faſteſt, <hi>anoint thy Head, and waſh thy face, that thou appear not unto Men

                     <hi>but unto thy Father which is in ſecret; and thy Father, which ſeeth in ſecret, ſhall Reward thee openly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And likewiſe you may ſee in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> the 58th, what the true <hi>Faſt</hi> is, the Lord requires: where it is ſaid to the Prophet; <hi>Cry aloud, and ſpare not, lift up thy Voice like a Trumpet, and ſhew my People their Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, and the Houſe of</hi> Jacob <hi>their ſins; yet they ſeek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a Nation that did Righteouſneſs, and forſook not the Ordinance of their God: they ask of me the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of Juſtice, they take delight in approaching to God. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have we</hi> faſted, <hi>ſay they, and thou ſeest not? wherefore have we afflicted our Soul, and thou takest no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your</hi> Faſt <hi>ye find pleaſure, and exact all your Labours. Behold, ye</hi> faſt <hi>for ſtrife and debate, and to ſmite with the Fist of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; ye ſhall not</hi> faſt, <hi>as ye do this day, to make your Voice to be heard on high. Is it ſuch a</hi> Faſt, <hi>that I have choſen? A day for a Man to afflict his Soul? Is it to bow down his Head as a Bull-ruſh, and to ſpread Sackcloth and Aſhes under him? Wilt thou call this a</hi> Faſt, <hi>and an acceptable Day to the Lord? Is not this the</hi> Faſt <hi>that I have choſen, ſaith the Lord; To looſe the Bands of Wickedneſs, to undo the heavy Burdens, and to let the Oppreſſed go free, and that ye break every Yoke?</hi> 'So this <hi>Faſt</hi> that the Lord requires, is not to lay <hi>Yokes,</hi> and <hi>Oppreſs</hi> and lay <hi>Heavy Burdens,</hi> and to make faſt the <hi>Bands</hi> of <hi>Wickedneſs;</hi> but to looſe and to break ſuch things.</p>
                  <p>And further, Concerning the true <hi>Faſt</hi> the <hi>Lord requires; Is it not, to deal thy Bread to the Hungry, and that thou bring the Poor, that are cast out, to thy Houſe? When thou ſeeſt the Naked, that thou cover him, and that thou hide not thy ſelf from thy own Fleſh?</hi> (Do you keep this true <hi>Faſt?) Then ſhall thy Light break forth as the Morning, and thine Health ſhall ſpring forth ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily: and thy Righteouſneſs ſhall go before thee, the Glory of the Lord ſhall be thy Re-reward. Then ſhalt thou call, and the Lord ſhall An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; thou ſhalt cry, and he ſhall ſay, here I am: If thou take away from the midſt of thee the Yokes, the putting forth of the Finger, and ſpeaking Vanity: And if thou draw out thy Soul to the Hungry, and ſatisfie the afflicted Soul; then ſhall thy Light ariſe out of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity, and thy Darkneſs be as the Noon-day. And the Lord ſhall guide thee continually, and ſatisfie thy Soul in drought, and make fat thy Bones: and thou ſhalt be like a watered Garden, and like a Spring of Water, whoſe Waters fail not,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Now here is the practice of the true <hi>Faſt</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> requires of his People; and they that obſerve this <hi>Faſt,</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> ſaith; <hi>When they call, he will Anſwer.</hi> And you may ſee what glorious and happy <hi>Comforts</hi> they do receive from the <hi>Lord,</hi> that keep this true <hi>Faſt;</hi> but ſuch as <hi>faſt</hi> for <hi>Strife</hi> and <hi>Debate,</hi> and <hi>ſmite</hi> with the <hi>fiſts</hi> of <hi>Wickedneſs, to make their Voices to be heard on high, and afflict their Souls for a day, and bow down their Head as a Bull-ruſh, and looſes not the Bands of Wickedneſs, and does not undo every heavy Burden, and break off every Yoke, and let the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed go free, and does not deal his Bread to the Hungry, and clothe the Naked, and bring the Poor to his Houſe, but hides himſelf from
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:51448:399"/> his own Fleſh, and cloaths not the Naked:</hi> Such <hi>Faſts</hi> and <hi>Faſters</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> doth not accept, neither hath he choſen them. But theſe appear to Men with their <hi>disfigured Faces,</hi> and hanging down their Heads as a Bull-ruſh for a Day, like the <hi>Hypocrites</hi> to <hi>fast,</hi> as Chriſt ſpeaks of in <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.</p>
                  <p>And is it not the Command of Chriſt, that in their <hi>Faſt</hi> they ſhould not <hi>appear unto Men</hi> to <hi>Fast?</hi> And now you, that would force us to <hi>ſhut up our Shops</hi> on <hi>Fasting-days,</hi> or for a <hi>Day,</hi> does not this <hi>Fast appear to Men?</hi> and is not this the <hi>Faſt,</hi> that the Lord ſaith in <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> he <hi>doth not accept?</hi> for he ſaith; <hi>Is this the</hi> Faſt <hi>that I have choſen, a Day for a Man to afflict his Soul, and bow down his Head, as a Bull-ruſh,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Wilt thou call this a</hi> Faſt, <hi>and an acceptable Day to the Lord?</hi> Iſai. 58.</p>
                  <p>And therefore all God's People are to keep the true <hi>Faſt</hi> of the Lord from <hi>Debate</hi> and <hi>Strife,</hi> and the <hi>Fiſts</hi> of <hi>Wickedneſs;</hi> and that <hi>Faſt,</hi> that <hi>breaks the Bands of Wickedneſs, and undoes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very heavy Burden, and breaks every Yoke, and lets the Oppreſſed go free, and deals Bread to the Hungry, and cloaths the Naked, and brings the Poor that are caſt out, to his own Houſe.</hi> So every one that keeps this true <hi>Fast,</hi> their <hi>Health ſhall grow,</hi> and when they <hi>Call,</hi> the Lord will hear them; and <hi>the Lord will be their Guide continually, and ſatisfie their Souls in drought, and make their Bones fat, and ſhall be like a watered Garden, and like a Spring of Water, whoſe Waters fail not.</hi> Now you, that keep not this true <hi>Faſt,</hi> when you call upon the Lord on your own <hi>Faſting-days,</hi> does the Lord <hi>Anſwer</hi> you, and ſay, <hi>Here I am?</hi> doth the Lord <hi>guide you continually?</hi> and is <hi>your Bones made fat</hi> by him, and your <hi>Souls ſatisfied in drought?</hi> and are you like a <hi>watered Garden,</hi> and like a <hi>Spring, whoſe Waters fail not?</hi> But you that keep not this true <hi>Faſt,</hi> do you not want theſe <hi>Waters,</hi> which fail not? ſo your Souls are not ſatisfied in drought, but your <hi>Bones</hi> are <hi>lean,</hi> and you hear not the <hi>Voice</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>Here I am:</hi> and ſo you loſe the <hi>Heritage</hi> of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and ride not upon the <hi>High-places</hi> there; but come under. And therefore every Man and Woman, ſhut your hearts againſt all manner of <hi>Evil</hi> whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, and trade not with <hi>Babylon</hi>'s <hi>Merchants</hi> of <hi>Confuſion;</hi> but keep the <hi>Supernatural Day</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that is ſprung from on high, that is, by believing and walking in the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and being grafted into him: and this will bring you to the true <hi>Faſt,</hi> from feeding upon any <hi>Evil,</hi> and to the true <hi>praying</hi> in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> as <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> have taught: which <hi>Fruits</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> is <hi>Love,</hi> &amp;c. which <hi>Birth</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> is not a <hi>perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting Birth:</hi> But he that is born of the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> will perſecute him that is born of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> becauſe he will not follow the <hi>Birth</hi> of the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> with its weak, <hi>beggarly Elements,</hi> that entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles with its <hi>Yoke</hi> of <hi>Bondage,</hi> and its obſerving of <hi>Days, Months, Times, Faſts, Feaſts</hi> and <hi>Years;</hi> which the <hi>Birth</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> is to ſtand faſt againſt in the <hi>Liberty,</hi> wherewith Chriſt hath made it <hi>free.</hi>

                  <p>Now as for your ſaying, <hi>The Apoſtle commands to honour all Men; and ſuch as Rule well, are worthy of double honour:</hi> Now, if this <hi>honouring all Men</hi> were to <hi>put off</hi> their <hi>Hats to all Men, and ſhew all men their bare heads,</hi> then this <hi>Command</hi> you break your ſelves; for you do not do this to <hi>all Men</hi> generally: and if they that <hi>Rule well,</hi> muſt have double <hi>Hat-honour,</hi> then they muſt <hi>put off</hi> their <hi>Hats twice,</hi> and ſhew them their <hi>bare heads.</hi> Now, if this <hi>Hat-honour,</hi> and ſhewing the <hi>bare head,</hi> be an Invention of Men, and not from God, and ye cannot prove it by <hi>Scripture,</hi> and yet ſay, <hi>It is</hi> your <hi>Rule;</hi> then you Act beſide the <hi>Rule,</hi> and <hi>compel</hi> People to act <hi>contrary</hi> to your <hi>Rule.</hi> For where did ever the <hi>Prophets, Chriſt</hi> or the <hi>Apostles</hi> Command any ſuch thing?
